Now, it is a holiday and by convention and tradition everyone is supposed to gather together.

On one hand I feel bad for not celebrating with everyone like we did in the past, and by past I mean two years ago, but this guy is triggering to look at.

If I left at home with only him, I cannot leave the house unless I feel like shit, otherwise I will surely get triggered in the process of letting him know I am leaving. The most contaminating, and disturbing intrusive thoughts are really memories of different creepy interactions with him. I don't know what to do.

It isn't completely solved, but close enough. This is a guy that has hurt me in the past and didn't apologize, as well as one I have a lot of moral debt towards I haven't paid. Both are tirggered when I see him. This is a guy that would routinely interrupt me whenever I tried to safely vent out my frustrations by punching my pillow, causing me to self harm quite a bit more. He is also someone that witnessed me self harming, spying from behind his door, while I was hitting myself in my room, only to see that he was watching me, an experience that has been burned into my memory. That memory is often one of my intrusive thoughts. This is someone that I barely ever talk to.

t2_2nvk1ovs,"I need some thoughts.  I have done years of CBT ERP and ACT for my OCD.  I have treated it in the past with medication but am not currently taking anything.  I am struggling with severe obsessive thoughts over my boyfriend - images of him with others, thoughts that he's lying to me, thoughts that I'm not good enough, thoughts that im going to get cheated on, etc. I am a 28 yr gay male. Spending new years 
with my boyfriends family in a different on 
the other side of the country from my home. 
Tonight I broke down and tried to remove 
the last wall between us after the last few 
month ramp up of problems we have dealt 
with. 

When I met him, I was just dating to grow. I had Absolutely no intentions of finding the one. I have been working on my OCD for several years. Have not found relief in medication yet but have done lots of therapy. I knew my OCD could be a potential problem and was planning to heal it completely before settling down with someone. A little while after we decided to commit to each other, we hit a few walls that have taken some extreme amounts of work from both of us to work through. He also was not planning to settle down. But the more we have worked through these difficulties together, the more were certain we want to be together. So rocky road aside, we have been growing closer every step. 
Though I've hit a point where I cannot fight my OCD any longer. And while he has stated it has worn him down, he has short fought harder by my side than anyone else before. And has been working on his own stuff along side it as I have worked to reciprocate the help. 

To break down why my OCD has become so troublesome lately I'll provide synopsis of the events leading to this melt down. 
Several weeks after we committed to eachother, I stumbled on his porn addiction. It started by finding it on his browser by accident. When I asked him about it he initially told me he was not viewing it. When I presented the evidence to him, he claimed that he used it to get ideas for us to use for our intimacy. As time went on I continued to find evidence and ask him to be honest. I continued to tell him how important honesty was important to me, and that I did not mind the porn but wanted him to just be forthright in telling me. Everytime he refused to tell me he had used it until I had to show him the evidence. And I would then be met with defensiveness. 

Some of the responses id get were that this has always been common in previous relationships so he didn't understand why it was hurting me. I continued to explain it wasn't the porn that bothered me it was the fact that he would not be honest about it. I continued to reiterate that he could view it if he wanted but that Id just prefer he tell me and not hide it from me. I even tried to get out of my comfort zone and view it with him. But he refused to let me. After several weeks of this, it started leading me to become obsessive. The breakdown of trust started making me question more and more what was really going on. 
So I started going through his phone and uncovered how much deeper the porn problem was. He would view porn after he got home from work in the hour before I got to his house, often times Wed be intimate, and then Ild head home for the night. Only to discover the next day that he was right back onto porn sites 5 minutes after I had left. Again Id ask him to be honest and he would never tell me the truth. He even started downloading different browsers, using incognito, and etc to hide it. But I'm very skilled with computers and can usually find most anything. This is when I started having a complete lack of trust in him and got very obsessive. 

Because of my obsessions I did read and view everything. He had several explicit pictures of people saved to a Google drive (He hadn't saved anything to the drive since feb 2017) He still had contscrs from grinder and tinderon his phone with one person listed as ""bad in bed - do not hookup"". 
So time passed. We continued to address him needing to be honest with me through the porn stuff. Finally, atleast based on the fact that I can no longer find it, the porn has stopped. And he claims he is no longer viewing it. So now it seems he's being honest, because I cannot find it any longer on his phone/computer. Up until it disappeared though, he never once told me he had viewed it, even when I was sitting there with his browser history in my hand, until I showed him the proof.  However after discussion he finally told me he was trying to stop but was afraid of telling me because we had only been dating a short time at this point and he didn't want to break up with me over it. So he said he was trying to hide it while he used it less and less so that he could stop the addiction and not hurt me. So he said he was scared about telling me when he used it because he was ashamed. 

We talkrd a lot about rebuilding the honesty. He shared his sexual history with me, including details and numbers. Because at this point I was so obsessed with fixing this lack of trust and eliminating all the fears the previous obsessions had exposed. This is where things got more difficult. Because the history he shared with me did not match what his texts told me. He told me he had never slept with more than one person at a time. And he told me this multiple times. But because he never deletes messages, I read conversations with his friends where he texted about just having his first three some. He went into details with them about how it happened who they were, how weird one guy was for saying bro so much. And then about having his friends pick him up so he didn't have to have an Uber. I mean the conversation was very detailed. 

There were also conversations about him getting tricked into going to a sex club and having a party time. Again incredibly descriptive from how many rooms there were to what kind of things were in each room. He even included the details of being convinced it was a Waterpark so he showed up in a swimsuit and was embarrassed. 

On top of all that, there were freaking exchanges about how his life is just working and fucking. And times hed text his friends about just having the worst hookop of his life. And then conversations about how the last 4 guys couldnt last more than a few minutes. 
So obviously you guys understand how badly that started ramping up my ocd. He lied to me about the porn for 2 months. He told me his sexual history was more conservative and that he had never been to the sex club. And he didn't do hookups. Etc. 

So when I finally presented him with the evidence from the texts, he broke down and said that he was never being dishonest. That he never did those things in the texts, but continued to reassure me that the numbers be told me were correct. That he had not ever had a threesome or orgy or had gone to a sex club.  He said that he texted those things to seem cool. Because he was trying to keep up a facade or character of someone cool to his friends. He continues reassure me that all of those texts were just ways for him to feel validated when he was lonely and feeling worthless. 

Because he wanted to seem cool. And he said that a lot of those details were things heheard from people and so it made it easy to fabricate stories that made him feel cool. 
Now as the weeks started leading up to him bringing me here to his hometown for new years, my ocd has been going insane. Being back here where all these people from his 
contacts are. And where all the stuff written about in those texts would have happened if they actually did. 

I want to believe him that he was hurting andinsecure and trying to sound cool over texts, but as you guys understand, my ocd keeps sending me thought after thought. And possibility after possibility that he is still lying to me. And still hiding it from me. 
After weeks of asking for reassurance and explaining to him my need for truth and affirmation and everything that I need to feel secure in the relationship I still feel like he's lying to me. 

He said he has stopped using porn completely cold turkey - without me asking him to, I was simply asking for honesty. Because he says he enjoys saving it for our intimacy and recognizes that he was obsessed and had been wanting to break free. 
He deleted all his contacts - without me asking him to. He said he didn't even really think about them being there, and when we got into the relationship he just didn't think about it. 

He deleted his snapchat - without me asking him to. Because he said there were too many contacts to just delete them individually, he doesn't use it. And didn't want to have people randomly message him in the future. 

He deleted all the explicit pictures, to his credit on this one, they were in a Google drive that had not been touched in two years. So I can believe him when he said they were old and he had forgotten about them. 

He has been touchy and affirming. He has continued to try and be proactive in telling me that those texts were all about show and didn't really happen. He continues to stand firm that his sexual history is exactly what he has told me. 

He came forward and told me that he has never had his drivers license, but was too embarrassed to tell me that because he liked me so much when we met. So he had originally told me that it had just lapsed. The reason he doesn't have his license is because he has severe ptsd from several car accidents when he was younger. 

But now I am stuck - my ocd keeps bringing the intrusive thoughts of him being this person who was fucking a hookup every few days or enjoying thresomes. And because the numbers he has told me were fairly higher than I had hoped, it continues to bring up images of all these different people. I feel like I can't trust him. I can't just believe what he's told me about those texts. And I don't know why I can't become mindful over these images this time. I had my ocd pretty much under control before this. 

I know that I love hm. And I know ne loves me. I can see the work he has been putting in. I can understand that he has his own mental problems to work through because of years of sexual abuse when he was little. I can see that he is trying to work on him and support me. He has taken ownership of lying to me about the porn. And he has said he is obviously telling me the Truth about his sexual history not linking with the texts, because it would be easier for him to just say yes all those texts are true. Because that would help show me to trust him better. It would stop me from questioning him more. But he said he will lot lie to me anymore, and so unfortunately he must continue to stand firm that the texts were just to make him look cool and thst he will accept having to continue to give me reassurance and work through this. Rather than lie and say they're true to just end the discussion. He also told me that because I didn't leave him after all the lying with the porn and holding strong until we resolved it, I showed him I was finally the one person he could trust with everything - he could tell me anything no matter how much it might hurt in the moment and that he was willing to be completely raw and honest with me because I had broken down that Wall and he felt like he no longer needs to lie to protect himself because I'm not gonna hurt him with the truth. 
I know I'm stuck in my head fiightjng all this. I can't see it all as I need to. 

It does looks like he's being honest now, doesn't it? 
It does appear he's stopped porn, right? 
It does appear he's acknowledged that he messed up and has gone more than the extra mile to clean up his behavior, right? 
If that's all correct. Then it is up to me to get these thoughts under control and heal so we can continue to build our relationship. We both want to work through this. We're not even close to the door. We in fact have been able to recognize the unhealthy aspects and want to heal them together as a team. But where do I start now? I am lost, overwhelmed by these images, and tired of fighting against the thoughts. I don't want to break up with him. Because I do recognize were not all perfect and he is trying to fix things.

One of these is one my triggers which happens to be talking about a particularly topic of my personal life which is easily avoidable in any conversation with friends and family.

t2_2wms380b,"Just want to say I’m not officially diagnosed yet as I couldn’t get a mental health referral until 2 weeks from now but I’ve been suffering with what I’m 99% sure is Pure O for the last month or so, and have had OCD-like episodes since I was a kid. I’m so scared to post about this as literally no one knows about all this except my boyfriend.

This all started with confession compulsions of what my brain considered to be “bad” things I’ve said/done/thought in my past to my current boyfriend. This escalated in the last month to ROCD, which led to me discovering that I’m likely an OCD sufferer, since i seem to fit pure O symptoms. After reading on this sub I discovered the other themes that OCD can present itself as, and this is when I discovered that POCD is a thing. After reading about it, I thought it sounded like one of the worst themes someone could have and hoped I would never experience it. So of course after that it was all I could think about, and suddenly my intrusive thoughts turned away from my boyfriend and towards children. I was disgusted with some of the things my brain could come up with, but have been able to get by knowing it likely wasn’t my “true self” having these thoughts if that makes sense, since i never had them before reading about POCD and had never had any sort of sexual thoughts or attraction towards children or anyone underage before. This helped me a lot until i remembered something.

A few years back i was reading a news article about non offending pedophiles being reported to the police by their therapists despite never assaulting children, and naturally the comment section had some polarising views. I remember feeling a little sympathy strictly to non-offending pedophiles, recognising that their attraction is not a choice they make and probably cause insane distress and shame to people, and should be able to seek help before they escalate and offend (just to be clear, once someone makes the choice to seek out illegal content or assault a child, I have absolute zero sympathy as they made a choice to act on their attraction and knowingly ruined lives in the process). I worried a little that this meant I had too much sympathy for pedophiles, and out of nowhere I had a memory from around 7-8 years before when I must have been 11/12 where I was changing my infant sisters diaper and may have touched her genitals out of curiosity (TMI but I was discovering masturbation around this time and suddenly knew what a clitoris did) . I instantly felt nauseous at the idea and had panic attacks on and off all night. I considered turning myself in to the police, and very briefly wondered how I could kill myself, but snapped out of that thought in seconds. 

However, the next few days I thought it over and realised that I wasn’t even sure if this ever happened in the way I was remembering it. First of all, it allegedly happened years and years before but I only suddenly out of nowhere remembered it, but only very brief bits and pieces of memory that seemed fuzzy. Knowing how much guilt I feel over tiny things and how much I overthink things, I found it very hard to believe I could do something so awful and just forget it by literally the next day (i have no memory of any past guilt over this event occurring or recalling it before).

 I also realised I remembered the event happening in different ways as I went over it, i.e at first I thought it was outright touching, then I remembered only accidentally pressing too hard as I wiped, which led me to wondering about whether this would trigger her to start touching herself later on, which my parents would notice and I would somehow get into trouble despite it being an accident (i don’t know if that makes sense but essentially I remember the event as having happened with both deliberate touching and accidentally touching her whilst changing her). Although I’ve never been 100% certain what happened the accidental one feels more like what actually happened in my mind. I feel about 75% sure this is a false memory because of this, as I even had doubts it could have happened before I even knew false memory OCD was a thing or that OCD was anything beyond excessive cleaning and hand washing rituals. Additionally, my anxiety reaction, obsessive rumination over it and compulsions and reassurance seeking is almost identical to how I feel and act now with my current obsessions that I know are irrational. 

Most of the time I can assure myself that I know I’m not a pedophile, I didn’t touch my sister deliberately, and that my OCD is attacking the things I love the most (my family and the fact that i really want children in the future) and playing on my biggest fears. However, in the moments I’m ruminating over these it all feels real and i can’t deal with the uncertainty that I could have done this awful thing in the past, even though I know it’s unlikely. 

Is there any way I will ever know what actually happened? As i thought it over more and more in the past it gets harder to remember and sometimes I doubt whether any of it even happened at all. How can I deal with this myself until I can speak to a counsellor? How do I even begin to explain this to a counsellor without them misunderstanding thinking I am a pedophile? How do I go about seeing my family without this overwhelming anxiety and shame taking over? 

Sorry if this is long and rambly, i just wanted to include as much detail as I could so this all makes sense. Also using a throwaway since this is the most shameful thing I’ve ever experienced and if anyone ever knew this about me I don’t know what I’d do.","POCD and false memories, how do you deal with uncertainty?",OCD,1,abpava,False,"Just want to say I’m not officially diagnosed yet as I couldn’t get a mental health referral until 2 weeks from now but I’ve been suffering with what I’m 99% sure is Pure O for the last month or so, and have had OCD-like episodes since I was a kid.

So of course after that it was all I could think about, and suddenly my intrusive thoughts turned away from my boyfriend and towards children. I was disgusted with some of the things my brain could come up with, but have been able to get by knowing it likely wasn’t my “true self” having these thoughts if that makes sense, since i never had them before reading about POCD and had never had any sort of sexual thoughts or attraction towards children or anyone underage before. This helped me a lot until i remembered something.

A few years back i was reading a news article about non offending pedophiles being reported to the police by their therapists despite never assaulting children, and naturally the comment section had some polarising views. I remember feeling a little sympathy strictly to non-offending pedophiles, recognising that their attraction is not a choice they make and probably cause insane distress and shame to people, and should be able to seek help before they escalate and offend (just to be clear, once someone makes the choice to seek out illegal content or assault a child, I have absolute zero sympathy as they made a choice to act on their attraction and knowingly ruined lives in the process). I worried a little that this meant I had too much sympathy for pedophiles, and out of nowhere I had a memory from around 7-8 years before when I must have been 11/12 where I was changing my infant sisters diaper and may have touched her genitals out of curiosity (TMI but I was discovering masturbation around this time and suddenly knew what a clitoris did) . I instantly felt nauseous at the idea and had panic attacks on and off all night. I considered turning myself in to the police, and very briefly wondered how I could kill myself, but snapped out of that thought in seconds. 

However, the next few days I thought it over and realised that I wasn’t even sure if this ever happened in the way I was remembering it. First of all, it allegedly happened years and years before but I only suddenly out of nowhere remembered it, but only very brief bits and pieces of memory that seemed fuzzy. Knowing how much guilt I feel over tiny things and how much I overthink things, I found it very hard to believe I could do something so awful and just forget it by literally the next day (i have no memory of any past guilt over this event occurring or recalling it before).

 I also realised I remembered the event happening in different ways as I went over it, i.e at first I thought it was outright touching, then I remembered only accidentally pressing too hard as I wiped, which led me to wondering about whether this would trigger her to start touching herself later on, which my parents would notice and I would somehow get into trouble despite it being an accident (i don’t know if that makes sense but essentially I remember the event as having happened with both deliberate touching and accidentally touching her whilst changing her). Although I’ve never been 100% certain what happened the accidental one feels more like what actually happened in my mind. I feel about 75% sure this is a false memory because of this, as I even had doubts it could have happened before I even knew false memory OCD was a thing or that OCD was anything beyond excessive cleaning and hand washing rituals. Additionally, my anxiety reaction, obsessive rumination over it and compulsions and reassurance seeking is almost identical to how I feel and act now with my current obsessions that I know are irrational. 

Most of the time I can assure myself that I know I’m not a pedophile, I didn’t touch my sister deliberately, and that my OCD is attacking the things I love the most (my family and the fact that i really want children in the future) and playing on my biggest fears. However, in the moments I’m ruminating over these it all feels real and i can’t deal with the uncertainty that I could have done this awful thing in the past, even though I know it’s unlikely. 

Is there any way I will ever know what actually happened? As i thought it over more and more in the past it gets harder to remember and sometimes I doubt whether any of it even happened at all. How can I deal with this myself until I can speak to a counsellor? How do I even begin to explain this to a counsellor without them misunderstanding thinking I am a pedophile? How do I go about seeing my family without this overwhelming anxiety and shame taking over? 

Sorry if this is long and rambly, i just wanted to include as much detail as I could so this all makes sense. Also using a throwaway since this is the most shameful thing I’ve ever experienced and if anyone ever knew this about me I don’t know what I’d do.

Has anyone ever lost their aesthetic attraction to the opposite sex because of HOCD?
When I say ""aesthtic attraction"", I mean the ability to find the opposite sex attractive, even to people who were attractive before OCD, to take an exemple :
To take an example: before when I saw a girl's picture, I could recognize the fact that she was pretty, tell myself that she was pretty. Now I see a picture of a girl and either it seems to have flaws, things I hold on to that make it much less beautiful, or I don't know if I find it pretty.

t2_sghkn,My gf was diagnosed a week ago and even though it’s her finals week for some reason she was too eager to start using Lustral 50.

I barely finished school, got severely suicidal even trying once during the hardest times and even during the easier times I still felt bad, got extremely anti social, could barely sleep etc. 

Point being I have tried full time work and I have tried studying but very clearly I mentally can't handle it with how severe my OCD (and diagnosed depression) currently is so I am living at home with my brother and parents basically therapy is my only focus and its been really nice mentally, I have felt calm and relaxed at points which I haven't been for over 6 years now.

My father calls my OCD a ""silly bacteria scare"" despite me trying to explain it on several occasions and how much it impacts me. Today told me that I would have to get a job or start studying soon.

I understand I don't deserve to be spoiled simply because of my mental illness but its very clear he doesn't give a shit about my mental health. I had thought I would be given more than 2 months to try and ""fix"" my OCD but that doesn't seem to be the case.

t2_mfcom1,"It's now been around six years since I was told I had OCD. From 2006 to 2015 I would usually have harm themes, sexual themes, superstitious themes and compulsion related to death, numbers, touching and rumination. In 2015 I developed a new theme. I started asking doubting questions like ""What if I don't actually like this/that/them?"" and I got stuck in confusion and I've been there ever since. In 2016, I developed a real life event theme and I started worrying that I had said something/done something bad in the past that I couldn't remember. These two themes rarely occured simultaenously. I would have a week where I constantly ruminated about the past trying to seek answers about what I had said when I was 14 and 20 and I felt like I could move on with my life and do things I loved if I got the answers. After some time I realized I shouldn't waste my time with that and move on and I could enjoy things in my life, but then I would  get the other doubts again ""do I really like eating chocolate bars?"" and start worrying about that, these two themes would co-exist and feed off of each other.   


A year ago I decided to get into therapy again, it had only been half a year since I had been in therapy. My therapist had tried to get me into an OCD program, but was told ""your patient sounds like they enjoy their thoughts"" and I was denied, which made me a bit mad, but I hoped I could see someone else. I found a new GP and told him I wanted to see a therapist and that I had OCD, something I felt was obvious. He then tried to get me into the same OCD program that I had previously been denied, I considered it a bad idea, but worth a shot. I also mentally gave up on all my dreams for the future and wanted to focus on getting better, because it'd be worth it in the long shot (I don't know where such a thought came from, but it seems silly now). When I was accepted to see the OCD professionals I felt like I put my life and future in their hands. I got really hung up on it and though I didn't have a future anymore I was really excited to see what could happen with my mind. This stopped the themes completely. I had no idea what I went into, but I thought from what I had read that I had been accepted and all I had to tell them what I needed help with. They asked me what I had been thinking about the last week and I told them what I had been thinking about, but that I usually struggled with the two themes that I've written about. After the first session they told me they couldn't help me and I had been denied. Apparently they said that the intrusive thoughts I had seemed to bother me, but not cause anxiety. After that my anxiety levels went nuts, I couldn't really go an hour without shaking. I also worried I was physically ill and about to die soon. It was a time when my mental health really had an effect on my physical health. This continued until I got a new therapist by my GP and I was told that we had to see if I was allowed to get therapy (at this point I had been so many times to the doctor that therapy was free for the rest of the year). So when I started going there I felt like an audition and I had to prove how bad I was. I got constantly confused and I had no idea what I was in for. Maybe I needed reassurance that I had OCD, had I become well? (that's what the OCD professionals said, that I was cured).

I never had done anything with a girl sexually at that time. So right before going to college I guess you can say I was practicing kissing so I wouldn't be a disappointment. As I was practicing, an image of my brother popped in my head and immediately became obsessive about it. I did not want to be near him because of the distressing thoughts. However the thoughts felt pleasurable yet chaotic. After that, it felt like that the picture has changed. I began obssessing if i was attracted to woman (which I felt no longer attracted to them). I then felt attracted to men I was obsessing so much on what was going on. Now I will say that when I was high school I guess I was curious and had sexual urges for guys. By my freshman year in college I said to my self that i was gay and was in relief (I also said I was gay when i was in high school but was attracted to woman...I think lol).  Ive made a post on a website for lgbt for support and help. Ive seen pictures of people who were trans and never felt like them nor felt like I was trans. By going into my sophomore year in college, being a gay man caused me depression and caused me to be suicidal. So I kept on looking up on the websites if I had hocd ( meaning someone obsessing about being a homo). Then i came across an article of someone who was suffering from hocd, then had tocd. TOCD meaning Trans ocd. I then asked myself if I was Trans and got scared. It was almost like it was a relief for me to say it. Idk if it was because I was scared to say it and that my mind was playing tricks on me. Now I no longer feel like a man. Pronouns like he/him are tough to hear now. When I say I am a woman it feels like relief but at the same time it makes no sense. I hate it soo much. Ive read so much that sexuality and gender are both fluid but how can my gender change when I identified as a gay man and never in my life questioned my gender identity when i came up with an article about someone having hocd and then tocd.

Mainly self-love (I am really mean to myself), treating the people I am closest with better, continuing to grow in my career in a way that’s meaningful, etc. I spend most of my time worrying and not actually doing anything productive to help these things. I am in therapy and have been for 10 months but I don’t feel I’ve made any progress.

To clarify, I am in therapy for possible OCD (Pure O) and to deal with my catastrophic thinking.

We had friends (boyfriends friends) over all weekend and they are kind of judgey people. Usually I can find flaws with people with that kind of personality and tell myself they are just insecure and jealous, but these guys actually have great lives with a lot of success so it’s hurtful hearing them put other people down. I am always careful with what I say and how I act around them for fear of being called out - I can be a little awkward sometimes. On NYE we had other friends join us, some that I am more comfortable around. I was drunk and acting a little crazier/louder than usual and I remember the judgey friends not engaging so much and just sitting on the couch. I also could read their lips and see them making fun of my pit stains during a game we were playing (it was unbelievably hot in my apartment). Basically I woke up the next morning feeling extremely ashamed of my behavior and lack of perfection, and I pictured them talking badly about me on their long drive home. They are fun to be around and we do a lot together as two couples but at the same time I often leave the situation feeling defeated. 

Does any of this make sense? 

On top of this I’ve been having some ups and downs with my boyfriend so I don’t feel comfortable bringing this all up. We’ve been together for almost 6 years and everyone was asking when he’s going to propose and that they wish an engagement for me for 2019. It made me feel defeated again because we are not in the best place right now - I’ve become very insecure and it ends up getting lashed out on him. This also gets brought up in therapy.

I’m basically just going over the entire weekend and what I could’ve done and said differently and all the things that are wrong with me. I can’t tell if my goal is to care less what other people think or to just be better.

Tl;dr - Feel judged by boyfriends friends for being a little obnoxious on NYE, feeling like this in general and feeling pressured to be proposed to but boyfriend and I are having problems because I’m constantly worrying and insecure.

t2_417aco,"So, a couple of nights ago I kinda freaked myself out getting out of my car and walking to my door. There’s a certain bush I don’t like walking by for bizarre ocd reasons and it was dark out. Anyway, I rushed out of my car and tried to get to where I felt safer as quickly as possible (which I know is avoidance and bad). The next morning I realized I left the car lights on and drained the battery. Immediately my mom starts yelling at me telling me how fear makes “people” careless, incompetent, and it causes harm to people around them. The reason I say “people” is because this obviously felt directed towards me and my condition. I just can’t really control getting afraid.

So I was really hurt by what my mom said and she does this thing where she pretends to go right back to normal like nothing ever happened and, I don’t know why, but it makes me so mad when she does that. So I kinda avoided her for the rest of the day because I was very hurt and uncomfortable and on the verge of tears around her. So I guess she realized I wasn’t really engaging with her when she spoke to me and she got so upset and said I was trying to hurt her, and her saying that literally broke me. It started to confirm all these thoughts in my mind that I’m an abusive person who manipulates people and I just wanted to shit out the world. 
I spoke to my sister and some friends because I literally thought it wasn’t normal for people to be upset with their parents and be a bit short with them.

I would never, ever, hurt a child. I want to kill myself because of this. It scares me that my intrusive thoughts are reacting to each other. Is this normal? Please help, anybody.

I don't have an official diagnoses, never talked to a doctor (psychologist?) about it. Still trying to understand who I would talk to about it.

I am thinking of going to university at the end of this year, in the UK. 

I have come to realise that although it's not as bad as it was at its worst (when I was maybe 12-14), and although I have managed, I'd say, quite well with it, it does affect my life. At the worst times it affects how long it takes me to do certain tasks, and it means some tasks I put off doing or I avoid certain situations etc. 

Of course I know I have made it this far without extra help/allowances in school, but I definitely think just knowing my tutor knows I have OCD and I can talk to someone about it if it's ever especially difficult, would be really helpful. I will also of course try to manage the same as people without OCD, try to get to lectures on time and do essays on time, but I know at stressful points, I do struggle with stuff like that.

I have googled about letting University know I have OCD, and they seem very respecting of it in the UK and it seems a lot of Universities have resources to help with mental health etc., but it also seems like you have to prove you have OCD through your doctor/medical record or something like that.

I assume that means I'd have to get a diagnoses for it, and I am not sure I'm ready to get a diagnoses. I am not sure I want my family to know and I live at home right now so I'm worried I'd find it hard to keep them from knowing if I got a letter or such. 

I'm not embarrassed about it, but I don't feel it's their business and not sure they would understand.

I don't know if I come across as really stupid, I know it's probably good to go and talk to someone about it, and I am okay with that but I not sure if I am ready to have them write it on my medical records (partly as I don't yet know what it would involve and am new to researching).

For now, or until I'm ready, would I be able to let the University know about my OCD without them needing to confirm it professionally? Or would they not take it seriously without a professional saying ""yes, she has OCD""?

t2_fuf1t,"Hey all. 

At first I wanted to come here and 'confess' something. Just to get peoples approval (reassurance). But that is not what I need. What I need is some help on how to deal with events that have or are happening where ocd latches itself onto. 

For example lately I've been getting alot of ocd about me being a new dad. But I'm mostly concerned about 'mistakes' I make. Which end up thinking I'm a bad father. Although some decisions made perfect sense to me at a time, if someone disagrees with me or even gets mad at me I'm unable to deal with that. I keep obsessing about what that person told me. 

How do you not let comments, opinions, even reproach  get controlled by ocd?? 

Everytime this happens, I get the thoughts like; 

\*Ive not changed, I'm still a bad person

\*This was the worst one of them all ocd is here to stay now

\*this must mean something about me or else I would not keep feeling bad 

Hoe do you guys cope with this kind of ocd? Also I think I should be careful when I say ;real event ocd about mistakes I've made. Because ocd in itself will try and turn alot of things into my own fault, and if I would try and treat them as 'real event ocd mistakes' I'm actually giving truth to the ocd labeling it as a mistake am I right? ",Real event OCD,OCD,1,am00w2,False,"Hey all.

While we were apart, I was struggling with the distance and family, and the fact that I was going to leave my family to return to England (his home /our home now) where we’ve lived together for almost a year. There were some days where he was unable to respond to my messages, and some days where his phone said he’d seen messages and not responded, while he responded to other threads we are both apart of. 

I felt so neglected and unimportant, and started questioning our relationship and whether I was a burden to him, whether I was negatively affecting his trip with family, and I withdrew, sending less messages, while simultaneously sending messages that I think were essentially asking for affirmations through a conversation. I came off as moody and unhappy, but was ineffective at expressing myself, and was also really just obsessing irrationally. 

When I saw him again, I was acting completely not myself. I couldn’t relax, couldn’t be honest with him, and couldn’t stop wondering why I moved to England in the first place if he didn’t want to be with me. 

This is not the way I feel. I love him and living in England, and I feel very motivated and excited about all of the things I’ve been / will continue to be experiencing. So I tried to speak with him. 

He was (understandably) upset that I was reacting with doubt and uncertainty, but more so, he shared that it really bugs him that any time we fight, I seem to think it’s the end of us, the beginning of the end, or it’s a sign that it’s not meant to be. 

He’s from a household where his parents are together. I’ve seen them disagree or overheard arguments, and they always sort it out and move on.

Eventually, they separated, and then my mother died very suddenly from unrelated causes.

t2_2mkwfp65,"Hello!

Today my SO and I are going to see their heart doctor and I’m going to attempt talking to them about prescribing anti-anxiety medications. My SO is not diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but... his symptoms are honestly making life very difficult. It feel mean to say that but it’s the honest truth. He keeps having panic attacks so bad he thinks he’s having a heart attack which just makes it worse. It’s often difficult for me to leave the house because he’s so anxious about something happening to me. I need to send several updates and even then he isn’t fully calm until I’ve been home a while. He has so many triggers that he can’t even enjoy what used to be hobbies because small aspects of them (for instance he can’t read what used to be favorite books because of how many pages he has to skip to avoid triggers) send him into panic attacks. 

The problem is that he will 100% refuse therapy. I don’t want to share his personal history but a childhood therapist severely violated his trust. I’m pretty sure if his doctor insists on therapy my SO will start panicking right there. 

My SO has printed off an online questioners in which he scored 30/40 for OCD symptoms. Until he showed me I thought he was struggling with just anxiety and didn’t realize all the internal things that were affecting him. Obviously the print out isn’t a diagnosis but it said to show to a doctor. 

So my questions are;

1. Is is going to be weird if I bring this up? My SO suffers from selective mutism and likely won’t be able to talk about it. 

2. How can we refuse therapy without seeming like drug seekers. We’re not necessarily asking for Xanax. He’d actually prefer something to take everyday that prevented the attacks than something that stopped attacks from happening. 

3. Advice on how to talk to the doctor about what is happening without sounding like “boo hoo my life is hard even though they’re the one with the illness.”

t2_b5agb,"I've had OCD since I was old enough to form coherent thoughts. Although some of my compulsions are physical, most are distinctly mental. I have severe hangups with repetitive thoughts, punctuality, time management, orderliness, and plans. Changes are extraordinarily harsh on me unless I have planned for them.

I've been married for three years. Sometimes it's very difficult because my wife is relatively easy-going and expects similar things from me at times. She seems to ""understand it's hard on me"", but because she doesn't have this debilitation, she often makes choices that send me into spirals. She's just trying to live a normal life. I'm simply unable to do so quite so easily.

Tonight, for example, we had planned to have pasta for dinner and watch some of the final episodes of Breaking Bad that we've been watching for the last few weeks. About two hours before she got off work, she texted me to say she was inviting her friend over instead. This change caused an instant spiral for me. The plans I'd had in my head for days now suddenly got turned upside down. Not only did the plans change, but I would now have a stranger I haven't even met before coming into my comfort zone and forcing me into socialization I hadn't wanted or had adequate time to adjust my brain to.

For my wife, she clearly views this as an inconvenience for me that I'll just need to deal with. For me, it's completely ruined my entire night and set me into a mentally destructive headspace of discomfort and irritability. With adequate time to plan ahead for it, I'd have felt mildly uncomfortable with the scenario but remained pleasant. Instead, it was thrown on me last second. 

These types of situations really make marriage hard for those of us with OCD. My wife's tendency for messiness would mildly annoy someone else. It makes me physically uncomfortable and mentally unwell to see her clothes thrown all around the room every day. It makes my living space significantly less comforting. ""Let's stay around the house this weekend"" means exactly that to me. A sudden blaze of energy from her on a Sunday afternoon to go out and do things completely unexpectedly sends me into a totally unhealthy mental zone. She doesn't see all the intricate, endless details I work out in my brain based around my expectations for a day. She doesn't go through my checklist of things I allow or disallow myself to do to ensure I'm properly prepared for specific outcomes and situations. She doesn't think about how I debated on having a cup of coffee (I have IBS too) and decided to under the expectation that ""we aren't going anywhere"" means ""we aren't going anywhere"". Then suddenly we are going somewhere, and now I have a nervous stomach and spend the day uncomfortable both mentally and physically trying to navigate myself through the hours until I can feel comfortable again.

These little things begin to add up. And I sometimes squeeze by and it doesn't affect me as much as other times. Sometimes I have good days and get through these situations with nary a problem. But some days it's so downright debilitating I end up wanting to just stay in bed and avoid ever having to plan anything or be expected to live up to any expectations.

I love my wife. I love being married. I WANT to be married. But damn if it isn't difficult to have someone else think of your OCD as you being ""minorly inconvenienced"" while you're losing your shit inside all the time. I feel like I'm always losing. Either I upset her by demanding for things to remain as planned in life and subsequently hear how awful that makes me, or I do my best to adjust while living every day in fear of what's next to throw off my rituals or expectations.

How do you guys deal with the expectations to live ""normalized"" in a mind frame that doesn't allow for you to? I know OCD isn't ""curable"", but I'm open to coping mechanisms.",Marriage is difficult with OCD,OCD,1,am7dff,False,"I've had OCD since I was old enough to form coherent thoughts. Although some of my compulsions are physical, most are distinctly mental. I have severe hangups with repetitive thoughts, punctuality, time management, orderliness, and plans. Changes are extraordinarily harsh on me unless I have planned for them.

I've been married for three years. Sometimes it's very difficult because my wife is relatively easy-going and expects similar things from me at times. She seems to ""understand it's hard on me"", but because she doesn't have this debilitation, she often makes choices that send me into spirals. She's just trying to live a normal life. I'm simply unable to do so quite so easily.

Tonight, for example, we had planned to have pasta for dinner and watch some of the final episodes of Breaking Bad that we've been watching for the last few weeks. About two hours before she got off work, she texted me to say she was inviting her friend over instead. This change caused an instant spiral for me. The plans I'd had in my head for days now suddenly got turned upside down. Not only did the plans change, but I would now have a stranger I haven't even met before coming into my comfort zone and forcing me into socialization I hadn't wanted or had adequate time to adjust my brain to.

For my wife, she clearly views this as an inconvenience for me that I'll just need to deal with. For me, it's completely ruined my entire night and set me into a mentally destructive headspace of discomfort and irritability. With adequate time to plan ahead for it, I'd have felt mildly uncomfortable with the scenario but remained pleasant. Instead, it was thrown on me last second.

As far as I understand, most people with contamination OCD have a specific fear like “I’ll get sick and die if I touch this contaminated thing.”    I do not have a “root cause fear” that I can identify.  I know I won’t get sick if I touch something that’s contaminated.   Today as part of my ERP I touched a water cooler at work that I feel is “contaminated,” then proceeded to eat lunch with my hands.   It wasn’t pleasant but honestly I didn’t feel much stress while eating because I knew the germs would not hurt me.   However, I still felt obsessed with the idea that my hands were contaminated and still felt a need to wash my hands after eating because I didn’t want to “contaminate” other objects in my office.   

I thought ERP is supposed to work like this - you expose yourself to the thing you are obsessed about, see that the thing you were afraid of doesn’t happen, then you eventually feel better because the fear did not materialize.     But in my case I don’t think I have an underlying fear - I know the germs won’t hurt me or kill me or whatever but still obsess over the dirt.

t2_11ahtf,"Hello r/OCD,

I had a recent experience that might be considered a “checking” experience, and I was hoping to see if anyone could relate or tell me if this is part of their OCD (I’m not asking whether I have OCD, though)

Background: I work at a lab at my college. Our PI sent out a schedule last week with all our shifts listed. He said the lab would be starting stuff soon, but not until he said it would.

The most senior undergraduate in our lab repeated this. Still, according to the schedule, I had a shift at 8:30 on Wednesday, and even though I was told TWICE (once after I asked if shifts started) that shifts didn’t start this week, I was still worrying about missing a shift on Wednesday.

So I went to the lab at 8:25 this Wednesday (he told us to be there five minutes early). Of course, nobody’s there - there were two other people scheduled to be with me this shift.

But what if they’re both just late? I check again at 8:30. Still, nobody there.

And yet, I STILL think that I’m making a mistake. One of the people who was supposed to be there was in one of my classes afterwards. So after that, I have to ask her. She says that since the PI hadn’t sent an email saying the lab was starting - like he said he would - that she didn’t go. I almost gave her a scare, because she thought when I asked that that she had missed her shift (and I still feel pretty bad about that).

And of course, yesterday, the PI sent an email saying the lab was starting next week.

So, would this fall under “checking”? I have a therapist for my anxiety, and when I told them about this, they said they would bring diagnostic criteria to see if I had OCD even though they weren’t sure if it was. I was just wondering if you guys can relate to this, I’m not asking for a diagnosis.

And guess what,I STILL can't let go of this fucking obsession with North Korea!

Mostly,whenever I try to think about them in a rational way,I get pissed the fuck off/infuriated...Maybe it's the fact that because of them I don't have any fucking idea if I want to go to Japan or not...

And also maybe I /we could really get killed because of these guys(with who we have in the white house,yeah..)..I guess it's the fact they could end up killing my(and others) ass that they scare me so fucking much..the reason why they piss me off so fucking much.

I cannot believe that this shithole country that cannot even feed it's people well has us dead to rights like this...I cannot BELIEVE that a country can pretty much fuck up the world single-handedly with no issue at all!

And then our fucking media and politicians think they're practically an existential threat to the fucking world,no,**THE WHOLE FUCKING HUMAN RACE!!**

And..when I try to say that everyone who tried to tell me it's gonna be ok...my mind just screams ""LIES"" and then the anger/despair comes.

And what's even worse is that there's a disconnect between people in the media,politicians and other people elsewhere between whether or not NK is threat,whether or not we will have war with NK,and whether or not they will fuck us all over single-handedly.

My mind is trying to make heads or tails of it all..and failing miserably.

I've wanted to go to Japan since I was a little kid,and now because of these chucklefucks,I don't fucking know anymore..or maybe I just have to accept that they WILL kill me and go anyway.

And I just can't accept that we could all go to hell because of them,I just can't fucking accept that shit!!!

But,I want to let go of this damned obsession with NK already!

This shit is ruining my life,it's caused me to waste a damned year,I've actually thought of suicide because of this shit,and my Japanese language skill that I was comfortable with and that could help me find a job,I have let deteriorate because of all this!

What the shit do I do?

Does anyone,ANYONE have any ideas on how NOT to be afraid of North Korea? To NOT be pissed off/infuriated at them?

Are there any therapists out there who ARE willing to discuss political matters like this which could help a bit?

And how the hell can you live with parents who are part of the reason for this(Parents who watch Fox news all the damn time...to the point where you have to watch something like MSNBC to drown it out?)?

This shit is really fucking me up mentally,and it looks like it really WILL destroy me..

I want this shit to stop,but I literally,legitimately,HAVE NO IDEA on how to stop this or how to curb/cure this!

All I know is that this fucking obsession is literally driving me insane!! And I want it to fucking stop!  ",Oh what the fuck am gonna I do...this obsession with North Korea is going to fucking destroy me.,OCD,1,am9s53,False,"Ok,so I asked for help here before-

It can not touch the wall of the shower when I put it on the shower shelf unless it’s been cleaned recently (the wall) When I wanna wash certain parts of my body I have to put the soap and shampoo behind the shower curtain or otherwise I feel like my filth will touch it and somehow get inside it.

t2_34vvm493,"So I know a lot of people don't take self diagnosis seriously but I do think it could be a possibility that I have OCD. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD and ADD. For the past few years I've had terrible anxiety stemming from paranoia and obsession for the safety of my loved ones and myself. I'm scared to see a psychiatrist because when I went about 4 years ago, they didn't take me seriously and kind of blew me off and it literally caused me to have a panic attack leaving the office. Here's some stuff that I do that I think might mean I have it and if anyone who does actually have it can let me know if it's just normal stuff, behavior that they've experienced, or if I'm just rlly weird that'd be great. I'm not looking for anyone to diagnose me I'm genuinely just curious and would like some validation for what I'm feeling because I do know it's not normal or at least I feel like its not.

1. When I was pregnant (it was at the time when Donald Trump and Kim Jong un were having that dumb twitter war) I was so convinced we would get hit by an EMP or we would go into a nuclear war that I would check the news online every morning when I woke up and every night before I went to bed. I obsessively googled how to prepare for a nuclear attack, what to do when a bomb hits, how high are the possibilities that we'll go into war soon, how to protect yourself from radiation and things like that. I would think about what I would do with my baby if that happened and basically saw visions in my head of it going down and different scenarios playing out over and over where I'd be hiding or fleeing with my daughter in my arms.

2. When I have the strong urge to self harm I see myself doing it in my head in much more violent ways than I'd actually do it in real life and sometimes I feel like the images will never stop

3. When I send long messages especially when it's a heated discussion or me expressing some way I feel, I'll read them over and over and over again and i honestly dont know why. (I'll probably do it with this post.)

4. I have a tracking app on my phone for my roommates, my mom, and my daughter's father. If my roommates take my daughter out I watch them on the tracking app the whole time and imagine all these different illogical scenarios where my daughter could somehow end up in harm's way even though I trust them completely. One time her dad had her and his phone died so I couldnt watch him on the app or call him and his mom couldn't get ahold of him and it caused me to have a panic attack 

5. Sometimes when my anxiety is really bad I feel like I want to jump out of my skin and I see images in my head of me just going insane and hitting everyone and everything around me, ripping my hair out and pulling at my skin 

6. I look for exits everywhere I go. My worst fear is being in the middle of a mass shooting and I'm not quite sure if that's logical or not

7. I dont trust airplanes, busses, can't imagine ever going on a cruise for fear of the ship sinking or pirates (someone told me thats a thing and now I dont think I ever will) or falling off the edge, won't go swimming in the ocean because of sharks and I barely can contain my anxiety when someone is driving a tiny bit over the speed limit

I'm sure there's more stuff I'm forgetting and you guys can tell me if maybe I'm just extremely paranoid and a little obsessive and it's not actually a condition or anything I need to possibly get medicated for or find coping mechanisms cause I honestly wouldn't know where to start. I just feel crazy sometimes and would like some input.

5. Sometimes when my anxiety is really bad I feel like I want to jump out of my skin and I see images in my head of me just going insane and hitting everyone and everything around me, ripping my hair out and pulling at my skin 

6. I look for exits everywhere I go. My worst fear is being in the middle of a mass shooting and I'm not quite sure if that's logical or not

7. I dont trust airplanes, busses, can't imagine ever going on a cruise for fear of the ship sinking or pirates (someone told me thats a thing and now I dont think I ever will) or falling off the edge, won't go swimming in the ocean because of sharks and I barely can contain my anxiety when someone is driving a tiny bit over the speed limit

I'm sure there's more stuff I'm forgetting and you guys can tell me if maybe I'm just extremely paranoid and a little obsessive and it's not actually a condition or anything I need to possibly get medicated for or find coping mechanisms cause I honestly wouldn't know where to start. I just feel crazy sometimes and would like some input.

t2_u64gi,"Hi everyone. I'm going through a really tough time and I would really appreciate any insight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the Christmas break, I was at my parent's house and I had these weird intrusive thoughts.

I had something like that before, but never as bad as this. 

&amp;#x200B;

But since then it's absolutely spiraled out of control. It feels like I'm obsessed with my dad, and I don't even know why anymore. I think it's because when the thoughts started I dealt with them in a very bad way. At the point, I should have immediately said to myself, these are just thoughts, you don't really want to do this, etc. But those thoughts are one thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I have now are two things. The first being a fear of thinking of my dad. In other words, I lay on a bed and I suddenly think that he gave me that bed, and then it all spirals. It's so frustrating. This is so powerful. When it starts it fucking crushes me, and it happens again and again and I just don't know what anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing is this strange thing that doesn't make any fucking sense but happens anyway. Something in my mind says: what if I associate this with my dad? Now, this doesn't make any real sense, but it happens. And the problem is that this gives me anxiety and then the next time I do that, or rather realize that, it gives me anxiety. Crazy things that aren't real. The thing with this is that it doesn't even exist. I've tried to explain this to myself. it doesn't make any fucking sense. It's like what if I associate the chorus of songs with my dad? and then I'm listening to a song and I remember and I get anxiety even though there is nothing. I mean what the hell ever is associating? It makes zero sense.  Also, this can be with real things and things that don't exist. Like for example a word, or a concept or a thought or whatever. Liking thinking of the future, it sounds crazy but it happens and I just don't know why or what the hell this is all about, but it's like oh I'm thinking of the future and I had a moment like I described above before with it so it's all bad now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with all of this is that what the exact DAD in this whole anxiety is is rather strange to me. Because it's like it's not even my real dad. There is no reality in it. It's all just blurry memories making me anxious, but there is no real thinking about my dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds crazy and shit and less than two months ago I would have thought the same, but in this current mental state, it's all so real and painful. And I have to wait for ages for help.

t2_348l7o8j,"Hi all,

I just want to rant about something that I noticed most of us doing. We’re putting too much power into the OCD that we experience.

First off, choosing words to describe ourselves goes a long way. It’s not OUR ocd, it’s THE ocd that comes in waves. It’s not OUR thoughts tricking us, it’s OBSESSIVE thoughts tricking us. 

Don’t make yourself one with the effects OCD. We need to weaken the bond we have with it to be able to see that much clearer when it comes to dissociating with intrusive thoughts.

This is by no means the cure, because we all know that everyone gets intrusive thoughts, and our bodies and minds react to the thoughts more-so than other people. BUT. I want us all to stop bowing down to “OCD” and give it the power to control us and define us.

Yeah, I watch horror movies and obsessively panic for days tha I might one day snap and hurt people. I have sex once in a while and spiral into believing that I have HIV, even though I took tests to prove I don’t have it. 

But that does not make me less than people who are able to let go of these thoughts that come into their minds. I’m not less than the people who don’t understand me.

It’s sad I put the OCD on a pedestal and let it make me feel bad about myself. Yes, it sucks that sometimes my thoughts can be debilitating, but the one thought that needs to be louder than the rest should be: “Thank you, but that’s not me. I know who I am. Next,”

t2_348l7o8j,"Hi all,

My friends and I got into the topic of our mental healths, and what we're doing to help ourselves. My one friend opened up about anxiety and being diagnosed with a few mental illnesses. That was my cue to open  up to them about a little bit of my OCD tendencies. I kept saying I'm scared of going to a psychiatrist to be diagnosed, because I don't want to label myself as Pure O. But my councillor said it does seem I have Pure O, even though she doesn't have the power to diagnose.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, before I said I really relate to Pure O experiences, my one best friend said, ""I dont think you should worry about being diagnosed because it doesn't seem like you have any chronic illnesses..."" That's when I said I really relate to Pure O. i didn't say this part, but I DO have intrusive thoughts about harm and sex that debilitate me for days unless I'm keeping myself busy and not being alone with myself.

t2_1uwob2a9,"Before I start, just want to say that I’ve never been formerly diagnosed. I’ve actually never even really considered having OCD until recently. I began and really look into it and my mind was blown by how many things I do that could be OCD that I thought were normal. 

Anyway, I have an obsession with bed bugs. The last 3-4 months, I’ve been itchy and keep finding bumps/rashes. I know it could be anything, I have extremely sensitive skin, but I cannot relax. I’m obsessed with looking things up about bed bugs. I’ve probably read every article about them on the internet. I look things up when I wake up, while I’m at work, laying in bed, at the bar, literally 85% of my day is me looking up bed bugs. Comparing my red marks and reading stories from other people and projecting my life onto it. 

I check the bed all of the time. I live at my bfs apartment and it’s a little messy which drives me insane but that’s a different story for a different time. The mattress has stains on it from who knows what, that have been there since I moved in, but I automatically assume it’s bed bugs. I have a hard time sleeping at night because I feel things crawling on me. I stay up until 2,3,4,5 am, every couple minutes shining the flashlight under the covers to look for them. Constantly checking the sheets and freaking out over pieces of black fucking lint. 

I truly believe my life will be ruined if we have bed bugs. My bf is so messy, I don’t think he would keep his stuff in bags and reduce clutter and do things you’re supposed to do when you have bed bugs. I don’t think we would ever get rid of them. Then we would go to move to a new place and we would just take them with us. I feel like this is going to be the rest of my life. I’ll never not be itchy. I’ll never sleep in a bug free bed. I want to have an exterminator come in but I brought it up to my bf so many times that it started an argument so I’m afraid to bring it back up. He doesn’t know how badly I’ve been obsessing over it because I’ve been hiding it, and I’m not sure how to talk to him about it. 

I have fears of other bugs that could be causing the itching too. Lice is right up there with bed bugs. My bf keeps itching his head and every time he does I silently freak out because I assume it’s lice. Then my head gets itchy and I feel things crawling. I’ve checked his head multiple times and haven’t found anything, it’s probably just dry skin, but in my head, it’s always the worst. 

I’m so itchy it burns, I’m tired of the crawling sensations, tired of constantly searching, tired of being depressed over bed bugs that I probably don’t even have because it’s been 4 fucking months and I still haven’t found anything. I really want to die. It’s ruining my life. I’m afraid to even go stay at my moms in fear of bringing them there.

I check the bed all of the time. I live at my bfs apartment and it’s a little messy which drives me insane but that’s a different story for a different time. The mattress has stains on it from who knows what, that have been there since I moved in, but I automatically assume it’s bed bugs. I have a hard time sleeping at night because I feel things crawling on me. I stay up until 2,3,4,5 am, every couple minutes shining the flashlight under the covers to look for them. Constantly checking the sheets and freaking out over pieces of black fucking lint. 

I truly believe my life will be ruined if we have bed bugs. My bf is so messy, I don’t think he would keep his stuff in bags and reduce clutter and do things you’re supposed to do when you have bed bugs. I don’t think we would ever get rid of them. Then we would go to move to a new place and we would just take them with us. I feel like this is going to be the rest of my life. I’ll never not be itchy. I’ll never sleep in a bug free bed. I want to have an exterminator come in but I brought it up to my bf so many times that it started an argument so I’m afraid to bring it back up. He doesn’t know how badly I’ve been obsessing over it because I’ve been hiding it, and I’m not sure how to talk to him about it. 

I have fears of other bugs that could be causing the itching too. Lice is right up there with bed bugs. My bf keeps itching his head and every time he does I silently freak out because I assume it’s lice. Then my head gets itchy and I feel things crawling. I’ve checked his head multiple times and haven’t found anything, it’s probably just dry skin, but in my head, it’s always the worst. 

I’m so itchy it burns, I’m tired of the crawling sensations, tired of constantly searching, tired of being depressed over bed bugs that I probably don’t even have because it’s been 4 fucking months and I still haven’t found anything. I really want to die. It’s ruining my life. I’m afraid to even go stay at my moms in fear of bringing them there. 

I don’t even expect anyone to read this or even care, I just needed to let it out because I have been hiding this obsession since it started and I can’t take it  Having a hard time.",579,4,583,0.157,0.807,0.036,-0.9974

The best way I can describe it is that I’m speaking more manually than automatically, similar if you had to focus on breathing. It seems like almost a hyper awareness issue. I was born with OCD and Generalized anxiety but throughout the years and through therapy and medication as a kid I’ve been able to control it almost all my life till now. I sometimes even forgot I had OCD. While no one has been able to really tell a difference in my speech, I have and it feels almost sloppy and like I don’t trust myself to get the words out. Kind of like learning to walk for the first time. I’ve always had a little social anxiety but I’ve kind of learned to get over that and have become a lot more social. That being said I’m not really sure why this has been an issue. I used to smoke marijuana back in high school and my first year of college but I would start to get anxiety attacks while high. Also while I was high I would be very self conscious by the way I sounded speaking so I think there’s a strong chance that smoking weed had something to do with it. However, I’ve recently changed who I am as a person and stopped some of my bad habits. I didn’t open up about this with my parents until over the summer and began seeing a therapist. His advise for me was just to just talk more often that way I would get comfortable speaking again. I’ve gone to him about five times and his advise has always been the same. He seems pretty confident in his approach and when he explains it it makes sense, however I’ve haven’t noticed really any change in my speaking. I don’t think he’s trying to get money out of me since he’s offered to follow up with me for free on the phone.

t2_rq7oe,"Sup y’all. After addressing my ADHD, my doctor and I decided it’s time to move forward with OCD treatment because I couldn’t enjoy the simple things in life anymore, and started to believe I caused a friend’s cancer and other shitty things, so when he said any SSRI will help me find joy in small things, I was hopeful. He also said I might not feel a difference in the first week.

I took my first pill expecting to feel 0 effect for a few days, but I actually felt a drop in bad thoughts and anxiety within a few hours. I actually slept for the first time in my life without performing a made up prayer to protect my family. Eventually I found joy in watching my dog  be silly, and color with my niece and nephew. 

My doctor decided it’s time to increase the dosage to 20mg instead of 10 when I mentioned a sudden drop in confidence from the night before for no reason. I couldn’t get any work done and it took me 5 hours to get started. Luckily, I work from home for an awesome company that wants me to be well and take care of my health. We also decided that I’d take it at night instead of morning because my eyes were puffy and I felt sleepy throughout the day.

I’ve been on 20 mg for 2 days now; first day, I slept for 3 hours and had reasonable energy(as if I had started my day after a good night’s sleep), today, I actually ended up missing work because my eyes were puffy and I had a migraine. I called my doctor and he said to stop taking Paxil. I have to fly to Canada for a work trip on Sunday, and really don’t want to risk withdrawals then :( 

My doctor said we can bring it down to 10 mg until he sees me again after my trip. It felt like I had to remind him I might go through withdrawals. 

I cried for a few hours because I’m scared of anxiety coming back to me, of being sad again from having obsessive thoughts, not sleeping because I’m doing a ritual for the 20th time because I messed up somewhere in the middle of the other 19.

I’m planning on seeing a therapist at some point, but I want to understand my symptoms as best I can before I see them. Does this happen to anybody else?  Are tics a compulsion?",126,4,130,0.015,0.888,0.097,0.9171

My therapist has been cautious to avoid diagnosis but I felt that my concerns may best fit this sub as it falls under what he describes as my recurrent “obsessive and compulsive behavior”.  Please let me know if I’ve posted to this sub in error.

I have a big issue with magical thinking. I am also a severely fearful flier, though I fly just about every month. Every flight is a battle for me usually fought with copious amounts of wine, but an upcoming solo trip from Doha to Tbilisi has me faring worse than usual. I always find that in the week or so leading up to a flight, my mental health takes a sharp decline and it becomes harder to reason with myself. I’ve had to really face this fear over the last year when my partner and I moved 7000 miles from home. I’m glad, in a way, that I am in a position now where I am forced to travel often or I’d probably never set foot on a plane again.

Anyways, my dilemma here. Lately I feel as though I am seeing “signs” of an imminent plane crash. These signs include: seeing 9:11 on my watch every day when I check the morning time, hearing about the plane crash in Houston as well as the two plane issues with landing and takeoff at London gatwick recently, constantly getting notifications from r/catastrophicfailure of plane crash videos and no other reddit notifications, and this morning I was reading a book to my partner and it started talking about plane hijackers. 

So, yes I know... logically... that these events are in no way connected to my upcoming flights. But I can’t help but pander to that stupid little voice that goes “what if?!” .. it’s awful. I reached out to a friend who is afraid of flying and told her everything, and she made things worse by saying “really you shouldn’t go on the flight, my dog just got hit by a car and I saw signs before.” She is, like me, overly superstitious and honestly I shouldn’t have even discussed my concerns with her but it made my feelings a thousand times worse. 

I find myself calling to my friends and therapist looking for reassurance that my plane won’t crash, which of course is not something that they could ever know. I seem to be unable to accept that I don’t have the answers, and it results in me becoming positive that the worst thing imaginable will happen and that the universe is letting me know.

t2_2krqhg8d,"TRIGGER WARNING POCD AND ABUSE 

I am a 20 year old woman with diagnosed OCD. Life has been incredibly stressful recently and my POCD has come back. It’s the most convincing it’s ever been and I am disgusted with myself and convinced that I am going to burn in Hell.

I was sitting on the sofa, anxious about university when the thoughts came in that I was a pervert. I’ve managed to convince myself before that it’s POCD and not actual pedophilia but this time my Brian was saying - just because you’re not into actual children doesn’t mean you’re not into 14 year olds (I find this idea repulsive) 

My ocd has a tendency to attach to things that seem ‘real’ - memories and experiences and this makes it all the more crippling because I feel like these moments become truth.

Most of my private fantasies are about much much older men and women and this is okay but this isn’t always the case

Basically i have recurring sexual fantasies that take place in my old high school with my old high school bullies and usually have fantasies about being sexually abused by a whole cast of people I used to know in high school. Abuse is a common sexual theme for me. I have had these fantasies since I was 14 myself and have never really considered them wrong because I figured I was fantasising about those individuals as they are now (ie. always the same age as me - 20) and not as actual 14 hear olds. In the fantasies I am never older than them - we are always the same age. 

Sometimes when I have these fantasies I feel disgusted with myself because the thought of sexually touching someone underage physically repulses me is and then quickly dismiss it because I would decide that no one was underage. in my fantasy everyone has aged the same as I have and we are all 20. I wouldn’t even worry about it and think that the fantasy is more based on the power dynamic than the age

But now I am consumed by shame and suicidal thoughts. 

Why do I still have the same fantasies I did when I was 14? Is it because I am becoming a pedophile? Am I evil? Am I imagining myself as a 14 year old ? Is it normal for fantasies to take place in high school? 

 I’m terrified and physically repulsed to the point that I want to be sick that because my fantasies take place in a school with people I only knew in school that means I am actually interested in 14 year olds and am a pervert and a pedophile.

I have never as an adult woman looked at someone underage and been attracted to them. I am repulsed by the idea of doing anything with someone underage but I am scared I am actually just a repressed pedophile making up excuses. I am in a loving healthy relationship with a man my age who I am deeply attracted to and every time he tries to so much as touch me at the moment I feel repulsed because I am convinced he doesn’t know that I’m a monster.

",stuck in POCD hell,OCD,3,awi5vf,False,"TRIGGER WARNING POCD AND ABUSE 

I am a 20 year old woman with diagnosed OCD. Life has been incredibly stressful recently and my POCD has come back. It’s the most convincing it’s ever been and I am disgusted with myself and convinced that I am going to burn in Hell.

I was sitting on the sofa, anxious about university when the thoughts came in that I was a pervert. I’ve managed to convince myself before that it’s POCD and not actual pedophilia but this time my Brian was saying - just because you’re not into actual children doesn’t mean you’re not into 14 year olds (I find this idea repulsive) 

My ocd has a tendency to attach to things that seem ‘real’ - memories and experiences and this makes it all the more crippling because I feel like these moments become truth.

Most of my private fantasies are about much much older men and women and this is okay but this isn’t always the case

Basically i have recurring sexual fantasies that take place in my old high school with my old high school bullies and usually have fantasies about being sexually abused by a whole cast of people I used to know in high school. Abuse is a common sexual theme for me. I have had these fantasies since I was 14 myself and have never really considered them wrong because I figured I was fantasising about those individuals as they are now (ie. always the same age as me - 20) and not as actual 14 hear olds. In the fantasies I am never older than them - we are always the same age. 

Sometimes when I have these fantasies I feel disgusted with myself because the thought of sexually touching someone underage physically repulses me is and then quickly dismiss it because I would decide that no one was underage. in my fantasy everyone has aged the same as I have and we are all 20. I wouldn’t even worry about it and think that the fantasy is more based on the power dynamic than the age

But now I am consumed by shame and suicidal thoughts. 

Why do I still have the same fantasies I did when I was 14? Is it because I am becoming a pedophile? Am I evil? Am I imagining myself as a 14 year old ? Is it normal for fantasies to take place in high school? 

 I’m terrified and physically repulsed to the point that I want to be sick that because my fantasies take place in a school with people I only knew in school that means I am actually interested in 14 year olds and am a pervert and a pedophile.

I have never as an adult woman looked at someone underage and been attracted to them. I am repulsed by the idea of doing anything with someone underage but I am scared I am actually just a repressed pedophile making up excuses. I am in a loving healthy relationship with a man my age who I am deeply attracted to and every time he tries to so much as touch me at the moment I feel repulsed because I am convinced he doesn’t know that I’m a monster. 

Apologies for the long post and for the disgusting things you have just read. I’m terrified. I haven’t been able to eat in 2 days and I feel genuinely dead inside. I’d kill myself if I wasn’t so scared of going to hell. 

Please please please if anyone can help me or offer some advice.

t2_23igf07r,"Hi all, I'm not really sure what the point of writing this is going to be but I'm starting to slip really badly into the crooks of OCD after it not really being an issue for years.
When I was about 10, I was initially diagnosed with OCD after my parents took me to see a doctor, who then referred me to a children's councillor. The reason my parents referred me was that I was having intrusive thoughts re: my Gran dying if I didn't act on a compulsion, such as the usual light switch flicking, tapping walls a certain amount times, having to step into entrances with a particular foot etc. They weren't majorly impacting on me at that age because it wasn't really something I saw as 'different,' but the thoughts would scare me to the point where I would stay awake at night acting on compulsions 'just in case.' It got to breaking point when I stopped eating because I was convinced that food was contaminated and at one point I managed to convince myself that items that people gave to me would either blow up or contamination would seep into my skin, which might not make sense but it was really scary at that age.
Anyway, I had CBT and I eventually seemed to just sort of... forget about it? I don't really remember what happened but it seemed to resolve itself. 
Around 15 I started self-harming, but it had to be a certain amount of times before I stopped otherwise my parents would die. The number of cuts increased until I got to 60, at which point I was re-referred to the adolescent team and was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression. At that point, I started taking anti-depressants (initially Fluoxetine) but again, it seemed to calm itself down.
Until recently, I found that I'd only get intrusive thoughts if I was really worried or anxious about something, and even then it was more pure compulsions than concerning thoughts, like touching something a certain  amount of times until it 'felt right' - I don't know if that makes any sense? 
I've been through a lot of personal trauma over the last 5 years (24 now) but recently over the last month or so I've noticed the thoughts come back to the point where they're impacting on my life severely. I'm in a relationship with a lovely guy and my thoughts at the moment are 'If you don't do (certain compulsion) then he will cheat on you.' He's away at the moment with a group of friends and one of them is someone he hooked up with a long time ago, and even though he's never given me the slightest reason that anything would happen, I'm absolutely terrified that it'll happen. He's a really lovely loyal guy and I feel like I'm going to drive him away by being so paranoid about it all because it's constantly on my mind.
To go into detail with my compulsions at present, I have to unbolt my door 4 times, lock the door, check the handle 6 times with my left foot on the doormat and right foot on a specific tile, then walk up my stairs touching certain parts of the walls and banister, flick the switch at the top of the landing 4 times, get into bed by only walking 4 steps, and when I get into bed and start to settle (I struggle to sleep as it is) I HAVE to make myself get up and do it all again. This can happen 15+ times and is really ruining my quality of sleep. Last week the doctor prescribed me a short course of sleeping tablets because I was absolutely exhausted and was starting to get really tearful. I didn't mention the OCD thoughts and just said I had a lot on at work at the moment because I just don't know what to say, what will happen and how to cope with it.

I never get reassurance from my therapist, but just knowing that I can say absolutely anything and will not be judged, shamed, or laughed at and WILL be taken seriously is unlike any relationship I have in my life.

I’m not even sure if I would call what I’m feeling transference, it’s more that I’m attached to the feeling of safeness and being able to speak so openly because I know my therapist understands OCD more than anyone else in my life, and I’m terrified to think of life without that safe space once I finish my treatment. I never get reassurance from my therapist, but just knowing that I can say absolutely anything and will not be judged, shamed, or laughed at and WILL be taken seriously is unlike any relationship I have in my life. It also doesn’t help that I’m pretty sure we would be great friends outside of therapy (note: I have no desire for that to happen and understand the ethics of why that is impossible, but it just adds a layer of complication to my feelings). We have not even discussed termination yet but it’s already on my mind (lol I could almost call this a new obsession). I guess hopefully once I’m through all my exposures I won’t feel this way but right now it’s hard not to.

t2_10u09l,"Hey! I originally created this post for [r/CompulsiveSkinPicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompulsiveSkinPicking) but have noticed a lot of people here asking about their skin picking and looking for help so I wanted to share it with you all. CSP, or compulsive skin picking, was also recently recognized by the DSM-V (that big book of medical diagnoses!), so a lot of research is finally beginning to be done on it.

As someone who has struggled intensely with CSP (compulsive skin picking) for the past 8 years, to the point where it's affected my daily life, the biggest thing that's helped me is learning about the neurological basis for the disorder, and accordingly, how to work on healing.

CSP has neurological ties to OCD &amp; BDDs which means that the habitual aspects can be broken like many other habits, and the self-perception issues can be attacked like many other mental problems - essentially:

***Tips for people with OCD or a BDD can be modified for CSP !!***

\*\*this is important because there's so little help for CSP currently - which can be so discouraging - but with a little bit of neuroscience and psychology knowledge there's actually a world of tips &amp; tricks to be modified for us!)

Here's an organized list of some of my most important tips:

1. **Environmental &amp; Emotional Triggers**: if certain routines, environments, or moods are often present when you are picking, those will naturally (and subconsciously even) push your brain to urge you to pick. Although this is frustrating, the way our brains work is wonderful and also makes it possible to consciously rewire this habit! (\*\*These habits can actually be so deeply in our brain that we are absolutely unaware of them! (I recommend reading The Power of Habit if you're interested in learning more). For this reason, it can be helpful to pay special attention to particular locations that trigger picking, you might not be aware of all of them!)  

   1. **Begin by removing some of these triggers if possible** \- that might mean: turning the lights off in your bathroom or removing mirrors, keeping makeup wipes &amp; moisturizer in your bedside table, taking a shower every day, and taking special precautions on days where your anxiety, OCD, or depression is flaring up.
   2. **Try and replace your habit with something else** \- A large percent of scientists weighing in on this topic believe that habits can't be removed, only replaced. Personally, I've found that skincare routines can sometimes take the place of picking. If I get to the mirror and am about to pick, I try and keep a drying acne cream to dab on the spot, so that I feel like I've done something about the issue.
2. **Rewiring Triggers**: Once you are aware of these, and feel mentally strong enough to avoid the trigger, you can begin rebuilding the synaptic pathways that link the urge pick to the stimulus! By consciously introducing yourself to the triggering stimulus but not picking, you work to disconnect the synaptic pathways that associate your bathroom, for example, with the urge to pick.  

   1. For example - After I had made a little progress in picking, I made a point of deciding that I'd look at my skin up close in the bathroom (a trigger) and walk away. You can even set a timer on your phone for a few seconds to knock you out of that focused fog that sometimes takes over. Even washing your face in the dark in your bathroom has the same effect! By removing one trigger (seeing your skin), but still introducing the trigger of the bathroom, you can give yourself a leg up on beating that habit!
3. **Don't be too hard on yourself!** \- any time without picking is real progress! Even if you relapse or begin by picking a little, it's never too late to get back to working on beating the habit. Keep things in perspective by understand that one or even three really bad picking sessions aren't undoing the neurological progress you've made! It's totally normal to fail and that never means you're back at the beginning! Good luck :)  

   1. Shame plays a huge part in CSP and it's important to begin by recognizing it and slowly working through it. As many people have mentioned, CSP is highly co-morbid with anxiety, depression, and OCD and can be a coping mechanism for trauma.

t2_2urmemyf,"I've been reading a lot recently on techniques to cope with my OCD and I've found that many people recommend ""accepting uncertainty"" as a method to overcome OCD.

But what about when the matter at trial in obsessions and doubt is actually 50/50, or even more? How do you accept uncertainty in that case? Does it mean that because my doubts and obsessions are close to being 50 % or more that they're true? Does it mean that in that case there would be no excape?

Absolutely. When it's tolerable it becomes easier to think positive. When you feel more positive you feel you can beat this.

t2_18jhwey,"Hi everyone, I hope this is ok to post here, if not, feel free to delete this.

Like the title says, my husband has OCD. I've been reading the resources on this sub so I'll try and describe what he struggles with as best as I can. I try not to ask him too much about the specifics of what he struggles with because he gets really anxious when he feels he's not explaining things well (even if he is) and I don't like to put him through unnecessary distress, so I apologize if things are vague or aren't correctly labeled.

So he told me this started when he was young (middle or high school) and it seems that his main obsession is mental contamination. The way he explained it is that if he saw something disgusting, he would worry that the image would not leave his mind and that in the distant future at a really crucial or happy moment (like birth of his child or something) the image of that disgusting thing would pop into his mind and ruin his happiness. I think he would then obsess over the mental image but idk what rituals he had for that if any. He told me one of his compulsions at the time focused on looking at things over and over until he felt the mental image of that thing was aesthetically pleasing. Almost like taking photographs of something over and over until you got the framing just right. 

He told me he went to therapy for some time and it helped him a lot. It seems to me he is doing much better than he was back then but recently as our lives have gotten a bit stressful (money stuff), he seems to be struggling with his symptoms again although they're a bit different this time. For example, yesterday he was picking up our dog's poop and a little bit got on his finger. After he washed his hands, he offered to make coffee but he was struggling to find all the parts of our machine (we just moved). After bonking his head on a counter, he went to lie down. I went to talk to him and he said that he was dealing with this obsession where he felt that after touching the dog poop, the rest of the day was ruined. I have anxiety/depression and have done CBT before, so I said maybe he should challenge the thought (since that's the advice I was given) but he said he didn't want to do that because then he'd feel trapped into challenging the thought over and over. That his brain would make him list examples of how the day *wasn't* ruined until he felt satisfied. I offered instead to help distract him, help him think of things he liked or was happy about. He didn't say anything, we just kinda lay there holding each other and after a while he got up and was able to make the coffee and to my knowledge, didn't think of the dog poop again.

Is that the right thing to do, distract him? He is VERY prone to rumination. I think he tries to avoid triggering obsessive thoughts by trying to sleep when he's overwhelmed, but it seems to me it's a really unhealthy response as he avoids uncomfortable situations he HAS to do (like pay a bill). He also has a lot of health anxiety. His grandma once told him that people die after they feel happy and fulfilled, and after we got together, he got so anxious about it, he had a really awful panic attack.

t2_2ukbr9hr,"Im sorry this is so long, skim as you wish....I’m a 21F and just the beginning of this semester did I genuinely sit down and validate to myself that, whether I have OCD or not, I’ve had an internal life that many people don’t know about and it’s been very difficult to begin to understand myself and have other people listen rather than try to relate or dismiss (whether they mean to or not) the things I have been going through, as they don’t even know the half of it.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that, at the very least, I need some validation that what I have been through isn’t just me ascribing some label for fun or out of ignorance. That what I’ve been through is at least note worthy, maybe not OCD, but maybe not great either. As a young woman of color it’s been hard to access resources and also believe my self in general, please be gentle with me, it’s hard enough to write this post.

When I was 13, I experienced what I now recognize as something similar to POCD. As an unsupervised kid on the Internet I saw things I very much didn’t need to, at one point I saw a “loli” image (idk too much about this soooo, that’s what I am gonna call it) and this spurred a year which turned into a constant battle  (I have a terrible memory when it comes to my mental health) even to today, of checking and testing and making sure I wasn’t a pedophile, yknow, the works. When I came to college I met a friend who experienced the same stuff, but back then I seemed like an isolated incident mixed with trauma.

Well, it turned out to be a bust, it seems like I spend so much time invalidating myself that I just forget how much, I guess, internal trauma, for lack of a better term, I’ve gone through. The first instance I felt this same paranoia/fear/fixation was when I was about 5 and I completely broke down to my mother as I was terrified of death, and her dying, and the fact I couldn’t control it. I was very young and my mom was freaked out, but she said the standard things a parent would, but ever since then it’s one of those thoughts I can’t control, even when I’m trying to relax or just be, the fear of death comes poking through. Which, sure that is everyone, but it’s painted an overcast over my life since then to a degree which seems unusual.

The next time I felt this feeling was at 13, when I vehemently decided I was an atheist the day of my first communion. I was in constant mental anguished during bible studies, considering why certain people were let in heaven, why anyone deserved to go, why the criteria as chalked up to be “asking God for forgiveness” and things of the sort. I couldn’t bear being part of the church, I felt inappropriate and fake, but the thoughts on morality and god never really left my mind.

Then 2012 rolled around and this sent me into a horrible, horrible year or so. I was 14 at the time, and it felt like a very real threat, I was gullible, but also incredibly paralyzed. I would check every new date they would post about which day the world was going to end. I did research and posted on forums and down every single day worried that I was going to miss the end of the world, that I wouldn’t be prepared. It was crying at night every day, it was watching the clock anxiously and everyone really took it as a joke, but everyday of that year felt the same, terrible dread, irremovable. Since it was such a meme at the time, not even my parents would take their child being in emotional distress very seriously (since they had gone through y2k, it obviously didn’t bother them). On one hand, I had a realist mother who would tell me we had no control over it and insisted I embraced the idea we would all end up in heaven. On the other, my conspiracy theorist dad validated everything I said and would send me links to more info.  They both were trying their best but I don’t think they understand how terrifying the situation was for me. This was the only other incidence that made me look up definitions for OCD at the time (with the POCD I also looked up symptoms).

And basically it goes on from there, almost every year there was something different layered on top of everything else. I’m bi, and although I am sure in my sexuality, every day I quantify my sexual/romantic attraction (which could also be internalized biphobia), but it’s stopped me from dating without feeling like a fraud, from participating in evens, from getting off comfortably without being struck by terrifying or disgusting intrusive thoughts (sexual violence and otherwise). That started around puberty and has followed me to today. Later in high-school, I had what I could only describe as a fixation with morality and spent hours in my room agonizing over what moral stances I take, why, what did this mean for me, and whether it made me an ultimately good or bad person (no middle ground) to the point of tears and exhaustion.  And when a family member suddenly past away, the intrusive thoughts about death came barreling back, which could also be grief, but it happened before when I was younger, only this time it had trauma attached. Once I came to college, the moral and existential rumination became stronger (I mistakenly took a lot of classes that might’ve fed into it all, like existentialism and ethics classes), and I find myself being politely interrupted by friends when I can go on for hours tops about different parts of a moral question and I am talking their ears off.

What I am meaning to say in all of this is that to me and others, it presents as general growth and thinking over things that plague us all. Even my therapist I have now has said that I shouldn’t peg this all on OCD. He says I have adjustment disorder and maybe a little anxiety, but that I am just a thoughtful and intelligent person. Which... that’s nice. And people say this a lot. And I do not even disagree... but it is, in my eyes, the results of years and ongoing years of internal anguish.  Am I just being dramatic, am I just going through things that people go through and am not strong enough to just leave them alone? Would you say these are problematic?

I believe they are problematic as... all of this occurs in the background until it doesn’t. Maybe one day I am feelings especially guilty about not doing well in school, and I get to thinking about why I’m here, an why I’m wasting my life away. And the general response would be to ignore all that, but to me it feels like I literally can’t help it. I get so depressed and sad and I can’t really talk to anyone about it because then I start going off incessantly or making people sad. I spiral for a few days, quietly, and then move on to obsessing over whether I’m just straight and being bi for  attention. It all switches on and off constantly, with age I have been able to cope with whatever is going on here, but the ability to semi-cope also makes me feel like I’m just weak and all of these intrusive thoughts are just thoughts and I’m stupid to believe I have some sort of disorder. 

I would also say I have compulsions, but they vary, and can often be spur of the moment instead of constant. My longest running ones are checking locks, checking my alarm clocks, checking for arousal, double checking if I’m breathing/if my heart is beating (this was one of my first ones, around the time I had the whole “terrified of death” thing as a kid), and some others.

I’m sorry this is very long, I just feel like I have some idea of what’s going on but don’t because everyone wants to insist I’m normal or smart or just having a tough time right now, and that it will end, but with recent self-reflection it feels like it’s been forever and that maybe I really am just the horrible person that my thoughts constantly insist I am, just really good at hiding it. It’s hard, I feel like I have had a good life otherwise and that I am just being weak, everyone else sees that I’m depressed and anxious and are absolutely dumbfounded because they obviously don’t see this stuff in my head.

I just need someone to say that this might not be just me, I don’t know. I just feel like if I can control all this, I’m a privileged sensitive brat who wants to be part of the OCD club. Thanks for getting this far if you did...

I’ve (25f) suffered from severe pure ocd, anxiety, and a little depression since high school. Right now I’m out of school, at my dream job, on a path to a good future and living with a wonderful boyfriend and my ocd is worse than it ever has been.. I can no longer function as a person.

t2_3iv7crf4,"I really don’t want to do the whole ‘is this OCD’ thing but this would really help me categorise my mental health problems right now.

I have very strong fears that others will misinterpret me and assume I am doing something harmful or criminal.

Recently, these have been:

When waiting for my partner to finish work, I was parked round the back of his work. There was a group of women nearby. I was a lone guy sat in the only car just waiting. I was honestly just terrified about if they thought I was a stalker or sexual predator. I am gay and definitely not a sexual predator. To be clear, my fear wasn’t about *being* a sexual predator, but that others would think I am. When I went home I replayed the whole situation for the rest of the night, imagining what friends and colleagues would look like to those people just parked in a car park. I go on emotional ups and downs, thinking things like “well you are entitled to park there and wait” (which is rational) to thinks like “no, being sat in your car for ages looks weird and they definitely took a photo of you as a stalker”.

At work I have to walk to the car park, and the top level is dimly lit. If there are any women in front of me I have to walk past them to make sure they don’t think I’m following them. My heart sinks when I see people who might have misperceptions.

Security in shops makes me feel guilty and anxious, to the extent that I may act weird or attract attention. I have never stolen anything in my life, or wanted to, but the idea that someone could think I have is crippling.

When driving in a new place I think I may have run people over and not seen them. I have actually redirected my journey and gone around again before now to make sure there isn’t a corpse next to the curb  or something.

Sorry to make this so lengthy, but some of these differ from a lot of OCD stories in that I’m not fearing actually doing any of these things but that people will perceive that I intend to.

This might be more in common with paranoia or something, but I certainly do have my ruminations and rituals around them (I.e. replaying the situation in my head for days after, Googling, going through the journey in Google Maps to make sure I’m remembering everything).

t2_2go9gwx9,"Hello, So about 6 months ago at the peak of my issues i was diagnosed with severe OCD, Anxiety and Depression. I was put on Paroxetine and since it has gotten a little better, but I've still got lots of issues that i need to find a solution for.

I have a really bad problem with an obsession about my physical appearance and getting into a relationship with a girl but i will begin with the physical appearance and move on so it all makes sense. So I'll just say that I'm currently 15 and a half so still quite young, however i begun with these obsessions about a year ago. 

So in the last 6 months i have lost around 30KG and have gone from 108KG to 82KG. I'm 6'4"" so very tall and am now well into the healthy weight range. I'm not fat (even though i constantly convince myself that i am) in fact a lot of people would probably even consider me skinny. I really can't stand to look at my body and it's much worse in the shower when i look down. I'm convinced that i need my stomach needs to be perfectly flat and can't protrude from my body at all. 

My hip bones are sticking out of my body when i lay down and if i suck my stomach in, the bottom of my ribs are visible and i can put my hands around them. I lost 15KG in two weeks as i went completely anorexic in terms of my diet (still kinda am) and i didn't eat for a few days at a time. The obsession comes from seeing people on social media with really skinny torsos and i constantly think that is what i need to be in order to be accepted. 

My GP said that if i lose any more weight i will soon be considered underweight and she will put me in a hospital and diagnose me with Anorexia. I've lost more weight in three months than most people can in one year. As a result I've got some loose skin around my stomach which is causing it to appear more like a dad bod than skinny even though i am skinny under it all. 

My second physical obsession is my facial appearance. I never used to have a problem until my OCD started appearing about two years ago. I have convinced myself that i am the ugliest person in the world and everyone thinks so. I constantly hate myself and almost bring myself to tears over it. i do all this despite being told by everyone around me that I'm average or even good looking and attractive. I have used websites that have some form of AI and tells you based on your facial measurements how attractive you are and most have said I'm decently attractive. I have posted here on some sub Reddits that get people to comment on your appearance and lots have said that I'm cute and have good eyes and stuff. 

Female friends have commented when i have asked them and said that i looked good as well. When i am out in public occasionally i see girls looking at me as if they are interested. However i constantly dismiss all of this and convince myself that I'm ugly. I stand in the mirror some mornings and make myself suicidal because of how ugly i think i am. Other times i have actually been reasonable and thought i wasn't that bad but this is not very common. Even though i know deep down the truth my OCD keeps dismissing this and i spend hours everyday thinking about this over and over again. 

Now onto the second obsession. I have a massive obsession, possibly even bigger than the previous one that i talked about. It's that I'm constantly in fear and telling myself that i will be single for my entire life and no girl will ever want to even talk to me. This constantly effects my life and i think that i spend at least eight or nine hours a day thinking about it. It plagues my mind and often i do cry because of how real and scary the thoughts can be. However, this stems from the physical issue because i don't think it's going to be because of my personality, in fact my personality is one of the only things i actually like about myself. It's once again only a physical thing and i constantly think that a girl will never ever want to be with me because of my physical appearance. 

Obviously being 15, i have never had a girlfriend and am still a virgin. This only amplifies the issue as not only do i fear never getting a girls interest, i also fear about the virginity thing. Also not helping, I'm home schooled due to my Anxiety and Depression so i don't actually have a way to meet a potential girl anyway. I'm not worried now, in fact i wasn't even planning on getting one until i was 18 but it's just the constant fear and obsession that drives this pain inside me. 

I have tried to be rational with myself by explaining to myself that there are almost 4 billion girls on the planet and all of that and it never works. I've tried getting help but most people think that I'm just being stupid because they think i look fine and wont have any trouble.

I spend hours googling what girls find attractive and whenever i have the chance to ask someones opinion on my appearance i do. I constantly check if girls are looking at me. Some don't which is understandable but when they do and i can clearly see that they are checking me out i still dismiss and think that they are looking at me because of how extremely ugly i am. 

I have been planning an entire life around this and have even gone as far as to researching prostitutes in my area so when i'm 18 i can actually go and do some stuff with a girl. It's just controlling my life and i can't be happy. 

I'm always sucking my stomach in to make myself appear as skinny as i can when girls around. I change myself so much around girls that it almost makes it awkward because i'm not very good at being something that I'm not. Everyone can clearly see what I'm doing because it's so unnatural but i do it anyway.

Anyway, thank you so much for reading this far if you could have been bothered. I know i'm a mess and really can't be fixed. I appreciate you for taking your time though.

It was so loud it made me jump and I looked around and it seemed like no one was freaking out or anything and I couldn't find what made the noise, I immediately thought it was a gunshot but I was in a pretty busy area so it's unlikely because it wouldn't be legal to shoot there unless (and this is a fear) someone was killed or attempted/committed suicide or something, but it was also so loud I have a feeling it was outside.

t2_331qfcw9,"I'll preface this by saying I'm 17 year old male. Even without mental illness, my life has been incredibly shitty. I'm not from a third world country or anything, but I've lived my entire life in poverty; experienced homelessness, sexual and domestic abuse, and extensive bullying.

Up until recently, the only thing I had a problem with was ADHD. After getting expelled for beating the shit out of a popular bully that was a year older than me in 7th grade in a fight he started, I went to a different school in a different state away from all my friends I'd had my whole childhood.

At this new school I was incessantly bullied. After having consistently been the top of my class in everything throughout my whole life, I had suddenly lost all motivation. My grades went to straight F's.

So then I went to another school three years later. I still didn't have any friends, but at this school (after two years) I met my first girlfriend, a stunningly gorgeous girl whom I had a ton in common with.

Suddenly life became too good to be true, but it didn't last long. When she left me I was once again friendless and I felt so much more hopeless than before. I became obsessed with her even though she no longer cared about me. Despite never talking to her anymore I constantly thought about.

I developed incredibly severe depression and terrible insomnia. I would wake up at a random time every day which lead to me dropping out of high school.

This is where my mental illnesses become a severe problem. I'm naturally an incredibly introverted person. Even with my closest friends, I can't handle being around people for more than an hour (unless it's a romantic interest) before I need to be by myself. This is part of why school has always been such an intense struggle for me.

Me having dropped out lead to me never having to be around people and my introversion lead to me being all too comfortable with completely isolating myself.

Once human interaction became a minimum I started making things up in my head to satisfy my overwhelming boredom.

Eventually, my inner monologue would start changing voices and I began seeing things that weren't there - such as a deer downtown that no one else saw.

My anxiety became severe. If someone starts talking to me now I begin shaking uncontrollably.

All of sudden I think everything's a conspiracy.

My ADHD has become insurmountable due to the time I've spent not doing anything. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that within ten seconds, my attention span for any given task has ended.

Once I was done obsessing over my ex my brain could only replace the hole by moving on to a new obsession. This lead to OCD. Very severe OCD.

I used to absolutely love reading. It was my favorite thing. I'd read for 12 hours a day. K can't do it anymore. My OCD forces me to reread every single paragraph over and over to make sure I get every detail, and then I immediately forget and have to read it again. It takes me four hours to read everything.

I've also convinced myself that every pole I walk past I have to touch, or else my mental stability will weaken even further.

Intrusive thoughts are the worst of all though. For me the most important thing has always been my identity. Who I am as an individual. I've always known exactly who I am but that's exactly what my OCD is attacking, and for whatever reason it's making me question who I am.

I pick one possibility. That possibility that once seemed nearly impossible will suddenly seem more and more likely over the course of two weeks and it will drive further and further away from sanity. The thought will follow me every second that I'm not preoccupied. It's the last thing I think about before I go to sleep, it allows me two hours of that in which it invades my nightmares, and then it's the first thing I think about when I wake up after a very brief slumber.

After two weeks that horrifying thought will have nearly brought me to suicide at which I point I think ""Fuck it, it if that is who I am, so what."" And then it's gone. As soon as I've accepted that it's a possibility, it no longer is one. And then I think I'm okay.

A few days pass and then another thought that has been slowly building since I abandoned the last one will serve as a replacement. This keeps happening, over and over and over again, and each thought is worse than the last. And none of them have been true, yet they're still killing me.

At this point I've accepted that my cause of death will inevitably be suicide. I daydream about not having to exist anymore, I just have to let one of these thoughts push me to the limit.

It's bizarre because a year ago I knew exactly who I wanted to be and I had a clear and personal sense of right and wrong. I still have that - I just don't know it anymore, I only *think* I know it, which means that I really do know it, I just think I don't. If only I knew now what I knew then.

My mood will rotate back and forth between euphoric happiness and suicidal urges in a matter of seconds, then go straight back to happiness. Oh well.

Once I was done obsessing over my ex my brain could only replace the hole by moving on to a new obsession. This lead to OCD. Very severe OCD.

I used to absolutely love reading. It was my favorite thing. I'd read for 12 hours a day. K can't do it anymore. My OCD forces me to reread every single paragraph over and over to make sure I get every detail, and then I immediately forget and have to read it again. It takes me four hours to read everything.

I've also convinced myself that every pole I walk past I have to touch, or else my mental stability will weaken even further.

Intrusive thoughts are the worst of all though. For me the most important thing has always been my identity. Who I am as an individual. I've always known exactly who I am but that's exactly what my OCD is attacking, and for whatever reason it's making me question who I am.

I pick one possibility. That possibility that once seemed nearly impossible will suddenly seem more and more likely over the course of two weeks and it will drive further and further away from sanity. The thought will follow me every second that I'm not preoccupied. It's the last thing I think about before I go to sleep, it allows me two hours of that in which it invades my nightmares, and then it's the first thing I think about when I wake up after a very brief slumber.

After two weeks that horrifying thought will have nearly brought me to suicide at which I point I think ""Fuck it, it if that is who I am, so what."" And then it's gone. As soon as I've accepted that it's a possibility, it no longer is one. And then I think I'm okay.

A few days pass and then another thought that has been slowly building since I abandoned the last one will serve as a replacement. This keeps happening, over and over and over again, and each thought is worse than the last. And none of them have been true, yet they're still killing me.

At this point I've accepted that my cause of death will inevitably be suicide. I daydream about not having to exist anymore, I just have to let one of these thoughts push me to the limit.

It's bizarre because a year ago I knew exactly who I wanted to be and I had a clear and personal sense of right and wrong. I still have that - I just don't know it anymore, I only *think* I know it, which means that I really do know it, I just think I don't. If only I knew now what I knew then.

My mood will rotate back and forth between euphoric happiness and suicidal urges in a matter of seconds, then go straight back to happiness. Oh well.

t2_3izj1tzc,"I will keep this very helpful means of help that stops some OCD thoughts dead short, but, add to it if anyone becomes interested. 

First a little about myself. I have had OCD since age 19. I am in my early 60's and in spite of the disorder I have a graduate degree in mathematics. For the last two years I have been working on a project involving Artificial General Intelligence which required a lot of effort spent on areas involving the discipline of philosophy of the mind, specifically the subjective nature of our being.

What I discovered in my work led to a watershed moment with respect to what my OCD primarily focuses on. The disorder's focus is scruples. There have been times I had been lost for hours in ruminations leading to panic over my footstep along the ground in my back yard was perhaps wrong in the moral sense.

What I have discovered in my work is that wrong/right, bad etc are emotional views that are entirely subjective. They are not properties of the object like melts at 32 is a property of ice. 

We often through childhood training or being unaware of their subjective nature see these emotional views as properties of the object which they are not. Hence, if you try to create comfort for your emotional being by showing that the moral wrong envisioned as perhaps a property of where I placed my foot as it touched the ground is false you will try to no avail and just succumb to continuous hopeful rumination that only leads to panic.

Once you realize the emotive/moral wrong is completely subjective and not a property of the object, in this example where I stepped on the ground, then like the unicorn does not exist and (not unicorn) where in (not unicorn) unicorn is  real also does exist the following is true: Neither the emotive/moral wrong envisioned as an objective property nor emotive/moral not-wrong envisioned as an objective property exists in reality. 

The splendor in this is you can stop trying to show yourself that what you did was wrong is false in a manner similar to showing 5 +3= 7 is false because the objective properties seen as moral-wrong/moral-not-wrong do not exist in reality hence you can stop. 

Wrong, not-wrong as well as a host of other emotional views are never objective properties of the object these views are directed. Hence, there is never any real need to show your self they are not fitting for they can not be and it is only an illusion of the mind or encouragement by those who wished to control your behavior that has led you to the false belief.

t2_9g7msu1,"So, OCD and ADHD are supposed to be polar opposites in the brain, with OCD being caused by overstimulation of dopamine and ADHD being caused by understimulation of dopamine (sort of - I'm not a doctor).  So what's happening right now for me is kind of unusual.  Let me give you some backstory.


Had OCD quirks my whole life but never to clinical levels until I started having babies.  Was diagnosed ADHD when I was a child, but stopped taking meds because my mother thought they were making me wet the bed.


Went on phentermine for weight loss after one of my children and seemed to start to do better with my OCD.  Phentermine is in the same family of medications as amphetamine-based ADHD medication.  Stopped the phentermine because weight loss doctor stopped treating me.  Had another baby, OCD got worse again.


Finished having babies, got on all kinds of antidepressants, started seeing little changes for the better but not doing ERP yet because hadn't found a therapist yet.  One day found one of my old phentermine and decided to try it out for appetite suppressant that day, ended up doing a lot of work around the house and didn't do a lot of the rituals I usually do.


I read up on ADHD.  Turns out I have a lot of the symptoms, which is not all that odd since a lot of people with OCD and ADHD share symptoms.  Talked to psychiatrist about maybe having ADHD despite definitely also having OCD.  She gives me a prescription for Ritalin so I can try it out.


Now, we are getting ready to move.  I decide to make the house a 'camping' zone instead of a 'clean' zone.  Am doing better and better about not making a difference between inside and outside.  Sometimes I make great OCD-killing strides when on Ritalin, sometimes when off.  Still a little jittery on the medication if I haven't eaten well, but it does help me calm down at other times.


I can't tell if it's the Ritalin that is helping me or not!  At this point I honestly don't know if it's just that my hormones are finally calming down after pregnancy (10 months post-partum) or that my antidepressants are doing their job or that my brain is somehow changing the way it processes dopamine.

t2_24pt0pva,"Hi friends. OCD being the fun time that it is gets me in a particular bind when it comes to bats and rabies. I once had a bat in my room at night and had to get vaccinated. Ever since, my OCD has provided thousands of ways in which I have potentially been infected. As a result, I have received the vaccine post exposure vaccines more than once. So, not only do I have to worry about rabies, I then worry I have too much rabies vaccine. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

It's been two years since I last received any rabies vaccine, but my OCD is acting up again. I was walking home from a bar pretty shit-faced two nights ago. I saw something on the sidewalk that looked a lot like a dead bat. I was almost on the verge of blacking out, but I think my mind came rushing back as a trigger warning because of my fear of bats/rabies-- I recall coming upon the bat and being shocked, not it coming down and swooping at me. I live in New York City, in Manhattan. Bats don't often swoop down on folks around here unless it is Batman himself. That said, I took a photo of it that isn't particularly great as I can't really tell what it is. I also wrote myself a note about the incident on my phone but the note makes almost no sense because I was drunk. I mentioned ""stomping"" but I think I meant I stomped to get anything off my shoes in case I stepped on it, which I don't think I did. But I was also shit faced. However, if I was knowledgable enough to take a photo and write myself a note, I would assume I also would have warned myself of an exposure. I should also note I wrote ""nothing happened"", which I think refers to a non-exposure event.

Now I am in a muck of wondering whether to get rabies post exposure shots-- it is only two vaccines, but they cost a lot of money in the US and I don't have any clear evidence for exposure. Unfortunately my lexapro hasn't been working so well (I'm on 10 mg- low dose) so I also take Klonopin. If i didnt have my klonopin, I'd have been in the ER already making up a story about a definite exposure to get the vaccine. 

I've walked by the scene a few times since, but obviously whatever this thing is is gone...

I have been doing well the past couple of week with therapy and medication for my scrupulous OCD, like so good that I have been really surprisingly happy.

So yesterday I returned home to my rented house (where I live with two housemates) and found the back door and our yard gates wide open with no one home. I knew straight away the housemate who was responsible. This certain housemate is extremely slack when it comes to turning off lights and cleaning up after himself and I've let alot of things slide with him (due to not having the confidence to stand up for myself).
It concerned me, because I have belongings in my room that are important and expensive. Anyone could of easily walked off the street, into the house and taken anything. I know the possibility isn't that high here, but you never know. Best to be safe, surely?

So this morning, I worked up the courage and sent a message to the group (my two housemates) asking him nicely if he could just make sure he locked up when going out. This was a massive thing for me, confidence wise.

Thank you for reading!","OCD, Difficult housemates &amp; Guilt",OCD,3,bjfztp,False,"Side note: I struggle with OCD - intrusive thoughts, anxiety and depression.

So yesterday I returned home to my rented house (where I live with two housemates) and found the back door and our yard gates wide open with no one home. I knew straight away the housemate who was responsible. This certain housemate is extremely slack when it comes to turning off lights and cleaning up after himself and I've let alot of things slide with him (due to not having the confidence to stand up for myself).
It concerned me, because I have belongings in my room that are important and expensive. Anyone could of easily walked off the street, into the house and taken anything. I know the possibility isn't that high here, but you never know. Best to be safe, surely?

So this morning, I worked up the courage and sent a message to the group (my two housemates) asking him nicely if he could just make sure he locked up when going out. This was a massive thing for me, confidence wise.

But here's the issue: I feel.. guilty. I feel like I'm being over the top. Petty. A 'goody goody'.

I feel like I'm developing OCD. I've been feeling extremely stressed for about a few weeks now as I have university exams. Ever since 2 days ago, I have been repeating a specific phrase in my mind. It pops up in my head occasionally, probably several times an hour.

I have never been diagnosed with OCD, but I used to have exactly this same problem (and surprisingly, one of the phrases I would repeat was exactly the same as this one now) when I was 13-14. It was much more severe at the time, and I would repeat words constantly (every 2-3 seconds). I also used to have physical compulsions like checking the door handles, etc. I remember waking up one day and realizing I wasn't doing any of that anymore, i.e. my OCD had completely disappeared on its own, which I'm so thankful for.

My twin sister was diagnosed with OCD when we were 17-18 because she was repeating phrases over and over in her head (but more severe, also having inappropriate thoughts etc.)

I only have 2 weeks left of exams. How could those two weeks affect me though... I don't want this to turn into full blown OCD (I don't even know if that sounds reasonable).

I'm honestly really scared. For someone who's lived his entire life thinking that some miracle saved him from OCD, for this to happen now, it's causing me so much anxiety.

t2_1h4ivtgo,"Last week was incredibly hard for me.  Anxiety was rated a level 5/5 on my DBT worksheet almost every day (baseline for me is like a 2.5)  I found out my husband is sterile, and nobody was sure of the reason for this.  This naturally led to a bunch of worries for me:

* Is his sterility being caused by something we can't treat?
* Is it being caused by something dangerous for him?
* Am I also infertile, meaning that if we did eventually want kids we couldn't even do IVF?
* Do I also have something wrong with my health? (my fertility bloodwork was a bit weird, leading me to worry about medical issues)

Well, last week was absolutely horrible but with a few followup doctor visits, we learned that his sterility was caused by him not having a vas deferens.  He was born without it.  Meaning that if we DO want to have kids, IVF is an option because he most likely makes sperm.  We also learned that I have a normal amount of eggs and no major ovary problems, another thing I was worried about.

This is good news.  I cried tears of joy when I heard these things.  I relaxed.  I felt FANTASTIC!  But now that it's been a couple hours (yes, literally just a couple hours) I'm already worried about getting fired at work.  And like my earlier fears about our fertility, it's not completely irrational- my manager and I have always kind of butted heads and he holds me to an unfairly high standard compared to others on our team- but regardless of how true this is, it's very obviously my OCD realizing it can't latch onto my earlier fears, so it's finding something else to obsess over.

So I quickly wanted to share this, im not sure if I have OCD and how severe it is, maybe someone can relate.

Cleaning -  I have to clean very well and methodical, always using bleach to make sure things are clean as fuck.

Watching shows/movies - In the back of my mind, I always feel like I need to finish shows that I can just finish them as I have a list in my head, it weighs heavily on me and I feel like I sometimes can't enjoy movies/shows as I really just gotta get them off my list. an example of this, right now im watching brooklyn 99 and I feel like I must finish it and then watch GOT from the beginning, but that weights on me as I know I have to watch The office from season 2 and then I have like a bunch more shows to finish so that I know that I actually finished them and crossed the list.

Gaming - I have a list of games and I always feel like I must go through a game to finish it just so that I can cross it off of a list, sometimes I wont fully enjoy the game but ill play it so that I can finish it.

That's it without going into so much details.

I feel like the cleaning/shows/gaming is something that must have some sort of order and arrangement so that I can rest my mind.

Does anyone else relate?

Was thinking of taking pills for this as it is taxing on me.

I’m worried I’ll end up wasting time and money if I commit to a therapist that I know doesn’t use ERP, since I’ve read that ERP is often the best type of therapy for OCD. I’m not sure if different types of OCD require different treatment options, but thought I’d ask here. Thanks in advance!

I was diagnosed with GAD at age 14, Depression shortly after, ADHD as a college student, and BED then as well. While I struggled with the initial anxiety diagnosis, I was mostly numb to the other ones. I would go to therapies or take meds specifically targeting these things. I’m still on a med for anxiety, for depression, and for ADHD. So 3 different ones. 

Yet none of this ever seemed to have any lasting impact. Lately, Mindfulness and meditation have really appealed to me. I can now see why. It gives me the ability to accept the intrusive thoughts I have without interacting with them. 

I’ve experienced fear of hurting or killing my husband, family, and myself constantly throughout my life. I’ve been terrified of cheating on him, being unable to be care or love him (even though I do). I’ve worked with children for a long time and have feared being a pedophile. These don’t all occur at the same time by in waves. 

I fear running my car into people and other cars. I fear getting rid of certain items will prevent me from remembering something important about a relationship even if that item is very trivial. This has led to some hoarding and a very untidy living situation. 

What follows all these thoughts is the intense feeling that I am a terrible person for feeling this way and should not think those things. I try to FORCE myself to not think them. 

I have less of the internal compulsions now, but I feel that may be partially due to the amount of medication I take. 

Don’t get me wrong, meds can be very helpful for many and have helped me through tough times, but I think I have relied on them for too long and have not felt the full extent of my obsessions in a decade. For me, that’s debilitating because I cannot face them head on.

t2_wh5wd,"Hi all. I don’t really know if this post is going to have much direction, I apologize. I’m just coming down from a major freak out and could use some support from people who understand. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 19. I’m now almost 27. I also had my second baby a few months ago (who’s wonderful! Just normal baby sleep taking a big toll).  I put a trigger warning on because I describe a sort of anxiety attack. 

Anyway. It started today when I got it in my head I needed to watch the newest Jeopardy episode. It would be a good night and I’d have a good day tomorrow if I could make it happen. But we don’t have cable or a DVR and the kids bedtimes interfere with the local airtime. So I spent a good 2 hours trying to find a way to watch. Streaming sites, free trials of YouTube and CBS, geo spoofing, VPNs you name it I tried it. Nothing worked. I was trying to make it work before the last airtime and I was watching the clock get closer and closer. When it all failed, I snapped. It started as silently crying and trying to calm myself, but it just escalated to the point where I was screaming and hit my head on the floor a couple times. I also scratched all down my face with my fingernails and have awful scratches now. I only stopped because I’d accidentally woken the baby by yelling like I did and I hate losing control like that because it scares my husband and I hate hate hate making him feel that way. 

I think there were several other contributing factors (lack of sleep, my husband’s work schedule changing like 20 times today, potty training a toddler, eating junk, moving in 6 months etc.) but this is the straw that broke the camels back. I have a problem with making plans in my head and when those go awry, it sends me into a tailspin. Like tonight I thought we’d watch jeopardy and have dessert then go to bed. Tomorrow my husband was going to be off work so I could maybe get an extra hour of sleep but instead he’s going on early AND working this weekend. 

I’m sorry for how long this got, I just need to put something out there so it doesn’t keep festering. Do any of you have freak outs like that with self injury?

t2_f3ni57j,"Hey, I’m new. This is my first post here so I apologize if I’m doing this wrong

First of all, I have not been diagnosed with OCD, so I’m not trying to self diagnose here, but this is something I’ve been doing for about a couple years now, and Ive always thought that I was the only one in the world that did this and that I was some kind of nutjob 

Basically, I have this thing where every day, during specific parts of the day, I mentally (and sometimes out loud) say “Nothing bad will happen to me or any of my loved ones or idols today(night) or any time soon” as well as other things, then I knock on wood with the idea that if I don’t knock on wood, my thoughts will be jinxed and none of those things will come true. 

I have a specific schedule on this too, during night, right before I sleep, I list 30 things that I want to come true mentally, then knock on wood. And if I knock improperly, I feel like I have to do it again properly or else everything will be jinxed.

During the day, around 11:45 AM, I list 5 things I want to become true, and do the same thing

At 2:05 PM, I list 10 things I want to become true and repeat the routine. 

Also if somebody else talks over me while I’m doing this, I feel the urge to repeat the whole process all over again uninterrupted, so it gets me mad at times.

And I’m a high school student so in class when I do this I look crazy to some people because they think I’m talking to myself (which I am fair enough but I’m not actually having a convo with myself) 

My point is, I’m sick of this and I want to see if anyone else experiences this too and how they get rid of it. 

Once again, I always thought I was the only one who does this so I was shocked when I found out that this was a common symptom of a type of OCD, I thought I was just really really really really superstitious.  

Once again I don’t know whether I have OCD or not because I haven’t been diagnosed 

I have other things I do like this too: in the shower I have to turn off the cold water before the hot water, in the school bathroom I have to use a specific urinal, when I walk to places in my school I have to take a specific path, it’s maddening and I think it’s taking over my life 

TL;DR: Very superstitious tendencies in the form of tedious tasks that I feel like I have to do or else it will screw up my life, such as walking down specific pathways, excessive praying like rituals at certain times of the day, and very picky on my routines in general and I wanna see if other people have these problems or something similar and how I can get over them","Excessive knocking on wood, and other things",OCD,9,bjr1gp,False,"Hey, I’m new.

t2_7u6u0,"To keep it short, I’ve had panic attacks and obsessions since a young age. I’ve had periods of time where I wouldn’t sleep for fear of dying while sleeping, where I had obsession with manual breathing/my heartbeat, fears of going insane, losing my mind or hurting myself/others, and fears that nothing was real and that everything was made up in my head.

A few weeks ago, I started focusing a lot on my breathing out of nowhere, I couldn’t stop controlling it manually and I started feeling off. It’s been about 6 years since my last panic attack, and 3-4 years since the last time I got stuck on an old obsession (which normally subsided after a day or two). I decided to start on Fluoextine again (which I had stopped a few years ago) and everything was going okay for a bit. I felt better just knowing I was taking a step to push away this obsession again and start feeling normal.

However, thing started getting weird after 1.5 weeks of taking the medicine. Last Thursday at work I had a weird episode of what felt like low blood sugar or low blood pressure or something. I felt like I couldn’t breathe right and my heart slowed down and I had diarrhea, it sucked. I stayed at work and pushed through it. Friday, same thing, same time of day (around lunch). This time I texted my boss from the parking lot and told her I needed to go. She came down and talked to me and gave me a hug and was very supportive. I went to the ER, and they tested my blood sugar which was 98 which was pretty normal. They said to stop drinking coffee (easier said than done) and that I seemed okay now and to follow up with my PCP.

So this past Saturday I stayed at home on my day off and had another weird attack. Feeling like a drop in my body, like all the blood went to my feet, and I had diarrhea again too. I was so confused. I wasn’t stressed or anxious I was just sitting and felt fine all morning and it hit me around 12:30-1pm. And then Sunday I felt fine, no attacks, I hung out with my partner, we ate food went to the mall and no episodes or attacks or whatever.

Monday I was super anxious to go back to work after my weird attacks on Thurs/Fri. Despite my nerves, I was fine all day. I felt anxiety, which I can handle, but I didn’t have an episode or attack like before. Same thing happened on Tuesday too. I was feeling good like it was all over. But then yesterday, Wed, it happens AGAIN. I stay at work until the end of my shift and I talk to my boss, who is still supportive and concerned, saying I need to take care of myself.

None of this feels like panic or OCD related anxiety, but idk what’s going on. Does any of this sound normal to you? I have a follow up appointment with my PCP on this coming Tuesday, and today I stayed home from work because I just don’t feel normal since yesterday.

I said I banged my head under a table. She must have just accepted that answer and brushed it off which is why she doesn’t remember now.

Also when I was little I wrote my mum a letter saying sorry but I need you to take me to the doctors because I can’t stop picking at my skin! Any ‘impurity’ would have to be picked off, invisible or not.

I had scabs all in my scalp and all up my arms.

I’ve just recently been diagnosed with OCD, I have intrusive thoughts and visions about harming people (of any age) it scares the fuck out of me.

I tried to commit suicide in 2017 because of these thoughts (that I was an evil person) and was kept in hospital and put on new medication.

Nobody listened to these awful thoughts I had and I was too ashamed to tell people the disgusting thoughts that I kept most of it to myself.

BAD IDEA.

It festered, it got worse.. everyday has been a nightmare. I went to see a psychiatrist 2 weeks ago who diagnosed me with OCD alongside my bipolar and autistic traits.

If you are reading this and you think you have the most sickening, disgusting, vile and awful thoughts please don’t keep them locked in. Please tell someone, someone more than the internet. Speak to a doctor/parent/partner. 

Get some help.

My medication has been increased and I’m due to start psychology based around severe OCD.

Everyday for the past 15 years I felt like I had to kill myself until the doctor told me I had OCD and they were just thoughts.

Now I don’t have to die.

t2_3vbgwxwd,"Hey new to the whole Reddit thing. I’m sorry if I don’t do this correctly. I was dating this guy for 2.5 years. I would consider him my first real serious first love relationship. Throughout the time dating him he opened up to me about his ocd and how and why it culminated. A lot of tough conversations but I really loved and cared about him so I fought through. I deal with my own mental health issues plus the same with my family so I did my best to learn and understand ocd. At the 2 year mark he went out with his friends and got drunk and cheated on me. He told me the next day and of course at that moment I left him. Over that month though we talked and I decided to take him back. He was a good bf before that night and I felt like he def just fucked up. I set up ground rules and had all the tough talks. Why did he do it, why did it come out of the blue, was he happy with me? Attracted to me? If we took each other back would be happy especially knowing the relationship would not be the same. Knowing it would be hard. In the end he wanted it and we continued. It was rough at first but he gave me support, space, told me he would answer any and all question whenever I had any. He would be there to prove he loved and cared about me and he regretted it. It wasn’t just words but actions that took place too. He set up date nights and of course money and objects won’t make up for pain but he bought me flowers and little surprises here and there. He liked guns and video games. He sold all of it and gave me the money because he knew I was struggling and it would help me. He was good about money and I could see the happiness in his face that he had us back. Of course I had anxiety bouts every now and then but I reached out to him for reassurance. We had talks about if this is what he really wanted, if he was happy, and if my anxiety about cheating was to much for him I would tone it down. Because I Know constantly asking wouldn’t help in the end either. Anyways over the months it got better and I felt we were both happy. Now he was in school and about to graduate. He got a job offer in a different city and had to move when he graduated. That’s somethibg we talked about. At first he told me to not worry about it just focus on us first and as time for closer I made my decision to move out with him. He was ecstatic about it. We went out to the new city and looked around and everything. He seemed happy that I was going to and continue to be with him. Then about a month ago we met up after both a stressful day. He seemed normal. As we were driving to get ice cream he breaks down and I ask him what’s wrong. To tell me. Overall he told me he loved me but a smaller part of him feels like he would live with regret. We talked about hard things which led the conversation to him ending it with me. He told me he was confused as to what decision to make. He loved me but he would see other girls and think what would life be like with them. He also talked to his dad earlier that day and his told him maybe he should let this be his first love and who knows maybe we would reconnect later in life. (His dad cheated on his mom twice; now divorced) that night I didn’t yell at him or fight him or put him down. I just accepted it and told him that I’ll always love him and would forever grateful for all the help he offered me through out our relationship. That I wasn’t with him for his money or anything like that. I would stay with him if he didn’t graduate or couldn’t find a job or we stayed in the same city. As long as he was next to me that’s all that mattered but I accepted it. Kissed him and ugly cried hugged him and dropped him off. My question is over this past month of course I’ve gone through a lot of emotions. But I feel like he ended it because of “rocd” or his General ocd. In the past he one time started crying saying he felt like when I finished school (he wanted to help put me through school to finish) that I would just leave him. I reassured him I would never do that. He also told me he was afraid of commitment. During this past month I ended up giving in and messaging him. Not to convince him to come back. I don’t want to force anybody in a relationship. But just to tell him final things that I didn’t say that night because just emotions were high. I told him I’ll forever love him, grateful towards him, never hate him, and it broke my heart he left but I just want him to be happy. He messaged back quickly and said he didn’t hate himself (he said that a couple of times) and that he wasn’t ready for the commitment we were preparing for (in my view point he’s the one who set everything up. Never asked him to pay for my school or told him to make me move with him. He’s the one who even brought up marriage at a point which I told him maybe a couple years down the road) and that he was going to be unhappy out there with me. I did not reply to his message but again as time passed I feel like all of this was a result of “rocd”. Do you think I should message him saying I hope he is okay and that I hope he seeks help for his ocd because I felt like the break up was due to his ocd or rocd? Or should I just leave him alone?

I am worried about finding another job, but not to the point of being really anxious.

Some months ago a group of friends planned a trip to stay together for a couple of days, since we all live in different cities. Just before leaving, Ive got a call about a job interview for this tuesday.

Thing is, I just arrived yesterday to the city and all the fears and anxiety went back, to the point that I am seriously considering returning home.

I do not know if it is because of the job interview, or because small travels always make me nervous. But I was supposed to have a good time and I am not. I am full with anxiety and I want to cry all time.

I will not return home since I know it will be a getaway, but it is not fair that I cannot even enjoy a friendly trip.

My therapist says to accept such thougjts and feelings, but right now I can obly thing of the day passing in order to return home.

I’m not trying to write anymore posts regarding this but it’s bothering me so much right now. I think I have something called POCD, fear of being or becoming a pedophile. I’m 14 years old by the way. I know already that I like girls my age or older. I’m just concerned that I might also like children. I don’t mean like 12-14 years of age children.

Yesterday I wanted to test myself again, I’ve done it a lot already I just don’t remember how much I’ve done it. I test myself whenever I’m around children IRL, seeing if I like their voice, their small appearance or their looks. What’s bothering me right now is the fact that I saw an image, it was drawn like a portrait by someone on google images of a child in a bathing suit exposing their breasts. When I saw the image I wasn’t even that shocked, I said “What the hell? Why is this child naked?” It looked realistic and everything. But the thing that’s bothering me is the fact that I got an erection to the image, I’d even say that I liked the image. While I’m typing this right now I’m kinda aroused by the thought of it.

Whenever I’m watching TV and an ad comes on and it’s a child I’m going to start paying attention to the ad and questioning if I like it. I saw my therapist like three days ago and asked her questions about OCD. And she said she doesn’t think I have OCD but instead anxiety and paranoia. (When I’m in school I’m very paranoid and anxious all the time.) I feel like if I don’t pay attention to my groin area when I’m near a beautiful child I might get aroused.

I know that I have OCD and Depression, I know that it affects all parts of my life, but I also know that I have what seems to be some slight emotional trauma as a result of my time with religion. On paper, being an Atheist solves the scariest stuff, but life is a near-constant struggle to convince myself that this thing or that thing or that other thing don't prove christianity to be true.

Religion is different for everybody, but for me, the bad of christianity far outweighed the good. I spent at least two years petrified that people I loved might be in hell or going to hell. At that time, I was driven to prove christianity true because I wanted to go to heaven, and now I'm driven to prove it false because I'm terrified of the consequences if it's all real. My stupid fucking disorder pokes holes through every bit of evidence or arguments I find, and some days it genuinely feels like christianity is true and that my loved ones and I are in eternal danger.

My therapist's response seems to be to completely avoid engaging with it at all, so that we can set up exposure stuff. We did exposure stuff for a while, I spent half a year doing things like ""praying to the devil"" or ""imagining myself and my loved ones in hell."" I honestly don't think it helped at all. 

While her advice makes sense, I feel as though my brain is probably a little mixed up from all the christian research I had done over the years. Learning things like ""he who is without sin cast the first stone"" being known to be a later addition to the bible, it makes me wonder just how much I have in my head that isn't accurate. 

So I think ""maybe I should learn about the history of the bible from a non-biased source."" To clear things up and maybe show me some information that will prove to me, once and for all, that it's not real and nothing to be afraid of.

Yet that goes completely against the advice of the therapist. I'm not supposed to research. 

And yet, 6 months of exposure therapy didn't do anything.

I'm preparing to move (long story) and I'm gonna be sticking with her via video call or whatever, but I'm also starting to wonder if maybe she's just not equipped to handle my unique circumstances.

He is also the main provider and we move around a lot for his job (we're about to move to east asia) so it will be a bit difficult to find a therapist..

When I fall for somebody I tend to fall fast and hard and they are ALL I can think about for weeks/months on end.

When I fall for somebody I tend to fall fast and hard and they are ALL I can think about for weeks/months on end. Obviously it is very off-putting for me to show that side of things so I hide it, I have to calculate every text and conversation so as not to appear overly invested/overly emotional (I also strongly suspect I have Sensory Processing Sensitivity which is low-key hell when combined with OCD). I'm not a weirdo about it, I'm very careful to keep it internal but it is literal mental torture 24/7, waiting for the next text/call etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently talking to a Canadian girl I met on R4R who I have been talking to for 5 months. We are planning to meet next month and I can't get it out of my head that she is going to cancel or change her mind even though she's given no indications that she will. I don't want to keep seeking reassurance because A, It comes off as needy and clingy which I'm generally not, and B I don't think that actually solves my problem. I've tried everything and nothing seems to help much. I'm on medication, in therapy, I do weighted rucksack hikes after work for an hour every day in the mountains and weightlift every other day. I could use some advice around Romances",306,7,313,0.127,0.746,0.128,0.3607

I hope that I can ask for advice here. So, I am pretty average, 18 year old teenager who lives a life that is indeed stressful but not really that bad. I've been experiencing some really bad thoughts that were sometimes severely limiting my daily life. My thoughts that are most likely intrusive want me to scroll up and down pages, articles or switch internet tabs really fast, pause videos and read comments. These thoughts also forbid me to watch a specific youtube video, or listen to a specific genre of a song or feel specific emotions/think about specific things, touch specific things, say some words, be critical to someone, even sometimes forbidding me to even think critically about someone or step on some places. It is like someone is controlling me through the mind and I have to obey them otherwise I will be punished in the future. When I don't want to get punished I say to myself ''I don't risk'' and that makes me feel better, yes it is weird.

Sometimes I do win and do watch or listen to songs even if these thoughts are making me very uncomfortable, it depends. Sometimes these thoughts are very strong and I can't even touch a laptop or phone without doing the scroll up and down, pausing videos, not even talking about music. Sometimes they aren't very strong, when I am lucky. I don't know if it is OCD, I don't really think that my family has or had problems with mental health, I can't imagine that I have it. It feels so weird to know that you are the only one who can actually have this issue. I had some traumatic experiences in the past, bullying, getting my phone stolen, getting my bike stolen, toxic parenting etc. but I don't think that it caused it, it maybe made it worse because as I can remember I did have some OCD symptoms as a child but never really had such intrusive thoughts. I need your advice, thanks for reading and I really want some advice.

I had some traumatic experiences in the past, bullying, getting my phone stolen, getting my bike stolen, toxic parenting etc. but I don't think that it caused it, it maybe made it worse because as I can remember I did have some OCD symptoms as a child but never really had such intrusive thoughts. I need your advice, thanks for reading and I really want some advice.

By saying ''slowly killing me off'' I actually mean it is leading to suicide. My intrusive thoughts are slowly killing me off",359,8,367,0.177,0.706,0.117,-0.9847

I’m tired of being afraid of my annual physical with the doctor lol. Mind over matter. Pray for me to be strong.

I sobbed for days as workers came in and out tearing everything out. At first they said it would still be usable, then I come home and everything is gone. 

Having my own protected space is SO important to me. I’ve not been able to use public bathrooms or even bathrooms at other people’s houses or work for 3+ years now. 

It’s been 3 weeks and my parents still haven’t had things put back together. This is the start of the fourth week with no end in sight. There’s another bathroom in the house that every time I go in, I bleach it, i carry a caddy of my own soaps and TP with me, I feel like I can’t touch anything, it always feels so horrible being in there...

t2_2k5yoho4,"Now hear me out. I want to start ERP on my own as I can't really go to a therapist right now. I have been to McLean's OCDI as well as specialists, read lots of books and online information so I do have a decent idea of what I'm doing. I feel I have nothing to lose by putting in say 2 months of ERP on my own as it's better than just sitting around not making progress with my OCD.

My whole thing is that I'll get weird thoughts, and these weird thoughts will ""contaminate"" whatever I'm doing. It can be a sexual thought, pretty much always about a family member, or an ""immoral"" thought. For example, I recently was reading about Hitler (I'm a history major) and felt like maybe I ""admired"" him. Obviously this upset me. 

The compulsion in this case would be to reread that paragraph without having a feeling of ""admiration."" However, I didn't do that and logged into multiple accounts, including this one, and so they are now ""contaminated"" by me admiring Hitler.

I feel like I should undo the thought, delete those accounts, and THEN start with ERP. If I just go into it, it might be too hard to maintain because the anxiety from the Hitler thing will be too great. I sort of have a hierarchy, like thoughts about sex with my dog would bother me the least, thoughts about sex with a family member would bother me more, and a bad thought about a sex abuse victim or a thought that Hitler is admirable would be at the top of the scale.

I think the idea is something like, If I don't delete these accounts, I'm saying it's acceptable to admire Hitler. It is like the accounts have been stained by the feeling I may have had.

And, just as a side note, I don't admire Hitler at all, I think Nazism is one of the most horrible things that has occured in human history. But what if I did have a fleeting feeling of admiration?

Should I delete the accounts and then agree to stop giving into compulsions, or should I not delete the accounts and then just carry on?

As far as I know, my past isn’t terribly traumatic or anything. Also, I’m 22 (almost 23), Male.

Can MD be linked to DID? OCD?

t2_14e7d1ux,"I'm 21 F, and I'm having some issues that are really starting to affect me and recently I've been thinking about an ""obsessive-compulsive tendency"" diagnosis I got when I was 14, and I'm wondering if it's progressed or manifested itself in other ways? Really, I'm just wondering if I'm blowing things out of proportion or whether anyone who has OCD recognises my symptoms and thinks I should seek help...

So onto the facts/symptoms:

1). I've always been EXTREMELY fussy - I couldn't leave the house/would throw tantrums when I was younger if my sock had a crease in it, or my shirt sleeves were creased when putting on a coat (many other things too). My mum found ways to fix them so that  I was comfortable and would send me on my way.

2). When I developed breasts, I found bras so irritating. Not the feel, it was whether the straps were even, or the centre part of the underwire was exactly centred on my chest. Sometimes my frustration would have me in tears and quite a few times, I ended up taking my bra off under my shirt because I couldn't bear the feeling of it. 

3). I had a difficult time related to some family things in my past when I was around 14, I asked if I could see a therapist and they diagnosed me with Generalised anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The main tendency i had was when i was worried, scared or anxious that something bad was gonna happen, or if i felt like i had ""jinxed"" something, i would touch wood. Not the old charming ""knock on wood"" twice and I'm done, but an incredibly long and non-sensical chant (I won't say exactly what it is, it really is ridiculous). I had to say it perfectly, with even spaced breaths in-between words, if i was touching the wood, my hands had to stay in the exact same position or i'd have to start over. Sometimes i'd have to redo it dozens of times, until i was crying in frustration. 

&amp;#x200B;

As i grew older, i grew out of/worked on some of these tendencies and although they still manifest on occasions, i largely disregarded the OC tendencies diagnosis as i saw my behaviour at 14 as immature and attention seeking and believed it was just a symptom of this. 

However, i have been rediagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder this past year. No surprise there. But i still disregarded the OCD tendencies. Until now, when I started to become concerned with some of my behaviour, specifically surrounding clothes. 

\- i find it INCREDIBLY hard to wear trousers of any sort, because the idea that the seams aren't perfectly centred on my body drives me insane. I'm better at sucking it up now, and I've found some trousers that i can bear, but when i wear them i am anxious/uncomfortable all day. 

\- I'm late almost every single day because i become paralysed when trying to choose clothes to wear. Somedays it's worse, but recently, almost every morning nothing i wear fits right, or looks right or feels right, or is appropriate. I stand to stare at the multiple outfits in the mirror for sometimes 2 hours cumulatively and most days and reduced to self-loathing and frustration and tears. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never considered the above obsessive-compulsive, I'm guessing due to ignorance, until i was reading up about the condition and it listed symptoms like:

\- trouble with decision-making

\- reassurance seeking (another BIG thing i do, i seek reassurance on what i'm wearing with my mum and this often ends in arguments because i get so frustrated, and i am constantly seeking reassurance and validation in my relationship, which drives my bf crazy)

\- i've already been working on my anxiety, specifically relationship related. I get very anxious and have obsessive and intrusive thoughts, seek validation and feel temporary relief then get anxious that my bf will get annoyed with my validation seeking and then it all starts over again. I've read of similar thought patterns in people with OCD.

t2_14ljte,"I'm going to be a Doctor. 
I had many people doubt me, my family, my classmates, myself, my teachers, my grades. 
I've been challenged by many issues regarding around my life. Mental health, OCD, ADHD, Trauma, Break up, Loneliness, etc. 
But you know what. I don't mind being the underdog. I don't mind if anyone doesn't get me, it's fine. I'm the only one that needs to understand this hunger and fire inside my soul. 
I've been frusturated so many times these last few years and I need to get out of this tough spot. I need to get medicated, focus on the small steps, get my security check finished, start volunteering at the hospital, and grind on my own path towards Medicine. I gotta stop doubting myself and comparing my life to others. It feels alone but I'll prove anyone who doubted me wrong. It's in my intuition, I'll make it. It'll be tough. But I'll work on it. Doesn't seem ideal right now. But it'll happen. When I grow up, I want to become a doctor, make money for myself, find someone loving, spoil them, and be charitable with the rest of my money. Be a doctor to help lives. Make enough money to make a change in those who are in unfortunate positions. I'll spread the love. I'll continue to help the homeless because I've been in their position. I empathize. I'll be real with myself with this upcoming University year. Fuck the highschool classmates/Ex girlfriend/friends who mocked me. 
Fuck this depression, OCD, ADHD, I'm going to get a job, who cares how low it is. I'll make the money to get myself fixed. I'll risk it. I know I am not the best student, infact, I might've scored the lowest marks in my IB/honors classes. But that's a genuine struggle. Failure and setbacks is something only I learned. I'm going to be stubborn and be persistent. But I'm going to die real. Be the real me, and bring the real and great character of myself to life. I may have been broken and beaten but that's not enough to stop me. I got tired reading the success of other men and so I decided to pursue my own. I'll make this goal an obsession, I'll make my work ethic as compulsion, I'll dissociate myself from the negativity. 

Thanks NF, it does feel lonely but knowing I'm not the only person who is genuinely struggling and relating to your upcomings/shortcomings. Yeah. I'm definitely going to make it if I continue to have faith and focus on my goal. Today, I feel like I'm finally running towards success and I'm living the life I'm meant to. I promise (18M), I'll make it. There will be difficult days. But that's why we have a towel in the first place. To throw it in and try again. 

Edit: I'm writing this so whenever I feel like doubting myself or I am dealing with a hater. I'll remember well the success is in me.

I've been challenged by many issues regarding around my life. Mental health, OCD, ADHD, Trauma, Break up, Loneliness, etc. 
But you know what. I don't mind being the underdog. I don't mind if anyone doesn't get me, it's fine. I'm the only one that needs to understand this hunger and fire inside my soul. 
I've been frusturated so many times these last few years and I need to get out of this tough spot. I need to get medicated, focus on the small steps, get my security check finished, start volunteering at the hospital, and grind on my own path towards Medicine. I gotta stop doubting myself and comparing my life to others. It feels alone but I'll prove anyone who doubted me wrong. It's in my intuition, I'll make it. It'll be tough. But I'll work on it. Doesn't seem ideal right now. But it'll happen. When I grow up, I want to become a doctor, make money for myself, find someone loving, spoil them, and be charitable with the rest of my money. Be a doctor to help lives. Make enough money to make a change in those who are in unfortunate positions. I'll spread the love. I'll continue to help the homeless because I've been in their position. I empathize. I'll be real with myself with this upcoming University year. Fuck the highschool classmates/Ex girlfriend/friends who mocked me. 
Fuck this depression, OCD, ADHD, I'm going to get a job, who cares how low it is. I'll make the money to get myself fixed. I'll risk it. I know I am not the best student, infact, I might've scored the lowest marks in my IB/honors classes. But that's a genuine struggle. Failure and setbacks is something only I learned. I'm going to be stubborn and be persistent. But I'm going to die real. Be the real me, and bring the real and great character of myself to life. I may have been broken and beaten but that's not enough to stop me. I got tired reading the success of other men and so I decided to pursue my own. I'll make this goal an obsession, I'll make my work ethic as compulsion, I'll dissociate myself from the negativity. 

Thanks NF, it does feel lonely but knowing I'm not the only person who is genuinely struggling and relating to your upcomings/shortcomings. Yeah. I'm definitely going to make it if I continue to have faith and focus on my goal. Today, I feel like I'm finally running towards success and I'm living the life I'm meant to. I promise (18M), I'll make it. There will be difficult days. But that's why we have a towel in the first place. To throw it in and try again. 

Edit: I'm writing this so whenever I feel like doubting myself or I am dealing with a hater. I'll remember well the success is in me.

Unfortunately, she ended the relationship last week after 10 visits because she is studying for a certification that will take her out of the therapy field.  I'm starting over with a new therapist this week.

  
I identify as a food addict -- I engage in emotional eating and sometimes what I feel is compulsive eating, but I don't go on binges.   I also keep getting obsessed with the same topics.  I get intrusive thoughts about many of these topics whenever I am stressed out or feel lonely.  My main obsessions are the Catholic church, Islam, Mormonism, and circumcision.   Sometimes I will chant Mormon phrases like ""Pay Lay El"" or I will chant ""Allah hu akbar"" and make a motion of a finger across the throat.   I am part of neither religion.   I also do things like stick up both middle fingers and curse people out that I am angry with.  When I think I am bad or evil, I will chant ""Luciferian by design"" (speaking of myself).    I do none of these things around other people (99% of the time.   On rare occasions there are outbursts).  Sometimes I really feel like I am really delving into psychosis but that may not be a proper term.  Usually these ""spells"" don't last more than 30 minutes or 1 hour.  They are intense and I feel like I am out of control.  When I am around people and feel wanted or loved, it is good medicine for my soul.

I went to a community health center today and met a psychiatrist because I could get in quickly and a lot of private places have long waitlists.

t2_41bewqkp,"    My boyfriend (21M) and I (19 F) have been dating for a little over 3 years. Recently (about 2 mo ago) he was diagnosed with severe OCD. His OCD is taking a huge toll on him, me, and our relationship as a whole. He cannot perform daily tasks anymore without having a panic attack or just becoming extremely irritable, such as doing laundry, dishes, making food, going out, pretty much everything. He has started hating doing the things hes always loved. He had to leave his job because it became too much and he was having breakdowns every time he was there. He washes his hands upwards of 100 times a day and cleans items profusely. We are often late to things because his rituals of cleaning and handwashing can take hours. It had made me hate nights because he must clean things and wash his hands perfectly in order to sleep.
He lives with me in my parents house because his parents place is disgusting because his mom is a hoarder. His OCD cannot take being in that house for more than a few hours, if that. He has never been the type of person to yell at me and scold me but now times have changed. When his OCD makes him irritable, he snaps at me for almost anything I suggest or say. He will get mad at me if I accidentaly touch something that he sees as ""dirty"" or if I put one of his items somewhere that is ""dirty"". This has made me fear touching anything in the house really, I feel as if I have to ask permission first. He doesn't want to have sex anymore because he is scared of getting dirty. I am a very touchy feely person and he was too before the diagnosis. I always want to hug and kiss and cuddle but now those things are rare because he often doesnt feel comfortable with being touched. This hurts me greatly because I feel like I need that in a relationship and I'm so used to being able to do it with him. He knows he's hurting me but he just cant seem to stop. 

I have a part time job and whenever I have to leave for it he has a breakdown and suffers the whole time I'm there because he says it's hard for him to be alone. This puts immense pressure on me to always be home and cater to his needs instead of mine. I have been avoiding doing things that I actually enjoy because I'm helping him through panic attacks and helping do the rituals. I feel like I am constantly comforting him and helping him come out of a panic attack. I have an anxiety disorder myself, and when he is in an attack mine shoots through the roof but I do my best to ignore it in order to give my attention to him.

Whenever I try and Express how I am feeling to him, he just gets mad and says that he can't control how his OCD works, and I understand that, but it doesnt mean that I can't suffer. He revealed to me that when he knows he hurts me he has suicidal thoughts. We had a super super good relationship before this diagnosis. We never once fought in 3 years other than normal disagreements, we had an amazing time with eachother always. 

My boyfriend knows that his OCD is destroying his life, but he knows it's out of his control. He is a very good person, but OCD has made him into somone else. He goes to therapy every two weeks and sees a psychiatrist once a month. But it isnt enough. He is on his second medication but nothing has changed, actually things have become worse. Recently we went to the hospital because he was having thoughts of suicide and things became too much. The hospital mistreated him and did not decide to admit him. The only other option I can think of is going to an impatient mental heath unit or a residential facility, but we would have to travel at least 2 hours and it would be extremely expensive. I am just not sure what to do in my situation. I miss the little things he used to do like kiss my forehead, grab my butt playfully, hug me from behind, the cute little things. I can feel him not listening when I talk more and more because he is worried about other things.

 I feel trapped in a way because though I still really love him I am not happy. He doesnt really have any friends so I am his only support system. He has no where to go, his house is basically inhabitable to him and he doesnt have any other family around. And he says he needs me. I believe in him getting better and I want to be there for it, but the process is taking a big toll on my mental health. I love him so fucking much and I want him to get well and become closer to his normal self. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do as a partner or options to help him get better please let me know.

t2_2kkgtlw1,"Ok, so recently, I managed to fully decelop OCD. I’ve always seemed to have symptoms, but only recently did they really begin to really become more numerous and more noticeable, most likely due to the development of other anxiety disorders and depression that occurred a few years back. When I really began thinking that some of the things I was experiencing was OCD, I explained it to my mom but she basically just brushed over it and acted like it was nothing and just told me that it was my inner perfectionist. Later when I was actually diagnosed, I really hoped for some more support, however, it’s like no one in my family actually believes the diagnosis. They’re always judging me for my symptoms, especially the noticeable compulsions. I go to wash my hands for the fifth time in the row and there they are telling me how it’s unnecessary and how not everything is dirty and how it’s technically bad for me. Like yes, I already know that, you can leave your grievances at my OCDs doorstep but I guarantee they won’t open that door. When I freak out over people getting in my personal space and politely begin asking people to move, suddenly I’m the bad guy. How dare I ask my younger sister to move. Even if they have pretty much as much space to move around as they want, suddenly they’re the victims and I’m left to have a panic attack. There was another recent situation where I went to a local ice cream shop and a random guy accidentally picked up my order instead. He didn’t eat out of it or anything, but just him putting his hand on my flurry cup just set me off for some reason. Then later when my dad found out about my situation, he decided to inform me on the fact that everyone working there had already touched the cup so I had no need to freak out and end up hyperventilating and crying like I did when I got home after a series of triggering events (i.e. ice cream making my hands and everything really sticky, dropping my ice cream and having it splatter all over everything, sitting way too close to random people, etc.). Like wow, I had no idea that the workers had to touch my order. Fascinating. Do tell me more. But yeah, that alone is all just so frustrating. Then there’s my sister. Since I’m the oldest child, she has that tendency to try and do everything like me. However, she recently took it way too far. She doesn’t necessarily know I have OCD since she’s only 10 and I don’t need her knowing all that, but she knows I have triggers that will set me off. However, she decided that she wanted to COPY MY TRIGGERS AND REACTIONS.

t2_3afcwww3,"Hi! I’m an edgy high schooler n all that jazz but recently I’ve been thinking a lot about a “phase” I went through when I was in fourth grade, so at about 9 or 10 years of age. I’m not even completely sure that it’s even a thing that’s related to OCD but it’s 4am and I’ve just found that this subreddit exists and I think it’s the best place to post about it since I don’t really know anyone I can relate to. Sorry for the tangent, anyways, to the point.

I was about 9 when it all started and it was basically just this obsession with keeping myself away from “dirty” things, especially my hands. It slowly progressed and got pretty bad. I was basically a hardcore germaphobe. I would wash my hands multiple times if I even though I had touched something “not sanitary”. My hands became really dry and cracked and I would often go into anxious spirals about that because it meant germs and stuff could get into my cracked hands and get to me faster or something. I had to bring lotion to school but at times lotion wasn’t even sanitary enough for me. I remember having a huge breakdown over it as a small nine year old as we were switching classes and I had to be calmed down by my teacher because I was crying hysterically over germs and my hands and just how anxious I felt. 

The point I realized I needed to change was when someone accidentally spit on my lip while they were talking to me and I had a full on breakdown. I went to my room and cradled myself with my knees tucked in and I basically went into a spiral that told me it was inevitable I would die because this girl had spit on me. I’m glad that I realized the broken logic in that and I stopped behaving like that. 

Even though I stopped being that bad I recently realized that I still do that stuff subconsciously without realizing it. Our kitchen sink got clogged a few weeks ago and all of the water was filling the sink and it was this gross muddy tinted stuff with gross things floating in it and even after my mom thoroughly cleaned the sink and the area around it I still don’t think I could let myself touch it. I didn’t even walk near it for a few days. I’ll use the sink but I will not touch the inside of it. Now I’m also feeling concerned because our dishes get washed there and now I feel kinda scared to use them. I’m like this with other stuff too but I never pinpointed it to me being instinctively germaphobic. It just kind of erks me that after all this time I haven’t really gotten rid of my old behavior and it scares me that I’ll go obsessive again. I have enough mental issues as is, I don’t want more on top of it.

Hello world! (sorry)

I have been struggling with OCD and scrupulosity for many months now. I have likely had OCD for years, since childhood, but have only recently been diagnosed by a medical professional (and so it isn't the usual ""oh, you must be really neat and tidy!"" formulation of ""OCD"" seen in media and movies; rather it's the kind that is characterised by an anxiety disorder and is completely debilitating).

Part of me just needs to get this out there somehow.

My personal OCD (it differs from individual to individual) is marked by religious compulsions. I'm Jewish, and we have three prayer cycles, morning, afternoon, and evening. I routinely spend several hours a day in prayer (when it was really bad I could spend up to 5-6 hours just trying to complete the morning prayers). I've been working with a psychologist and have rules derived from a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach to try and deal with these issues, but long story short, it isn't working.

The psychologist (and my Rabbi) are using CBT in the form of time-based rules on the prayers - e.g. only a hour for morning prayers, however far I manage to get, I get. I can't seem to stick to these rules.

Specifically, my compulsions require me to say the prayers perfectly, no mispronunciations, thinking about the meaning of the prayers, avoiding intrusive thoughts, etc. Everything I read about Jewish laws as regards prayer talks about the importance of properly pronouncing prayers, order, intention, etc. So I end up in a cycle where I can literally spend half an hour saying one paragraph. It then ends up obviously affecting the CBT rules discussed above. Then I can't stick to the rules because I haven't even done a ""bare minimum"", even though this is exactly the situation the CBT is intended to produce (and treat).

So I am writing this, partly as a vent because I really just don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to accept that the rules regarding what prayers must be said and how they should be said may not be possible for me because the more I try and follow them, the less able I am to do \*anything\* once the OCD and anxiety kick in.

I'm trying to convince myself the treatment prescribed is a way of getting control of my mental issues, and have a more positive relationship with the prayers. So eventually I can do more, and better. But the ingrained habits coupled with long history of being told the importance of exact adherence to the rules of prayer are, at this point, almost insurmountable.

As an aside, I am working with my rabbi. He was the one supporting both the notion of time-based rules treatment, as well as ignoring mispronunciations. I just can't seem to get myself out of the OCD habits of \*having\* to follow the prescriptions on pronunciation, saying full prayers, etc. It's a complex issue but my life is falling apart, as you can imagine.

My stress and anxiety levels are so high that neither I nor my wife can deal with them anymore.

As another aside, my OCD is not merely scrupulous in nature. That's one manifestation, there are others including cleanliness and other issues.

Lastly, I did post this in r/Judaism as well.",Religious OCD and scrupulosity,OCD,2,c88mvr,False,"

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 19 year old guy from the Netherlands and 3 months ago I've been diagnosed with OCD. It was usually just about checking doors if they're closed or not so I thought it was not that bad. Not until I got my drivers license in March.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember the first day I sat alone in the car. I wasn't enjoying it. It was absolute hell. I always had the constant fear that I hit someone and I didnt notice. This is the beginning of it, I never thought I would feel this way as I always enjoyed driving with my instructor so much. Eventually these feelings became less, but I never ever sat in the car without fear of having an accident. People call me a good driver but my head says that I am a bad driver.

&amp;#x200B;

A little over a month ago, the worst happened: I got a panic attack while driving. I was at a parking lot backing out. There was a volvo next to me who was about to back out too but he waited for me to drive away. I drove a little forward and it looked like I hit the volvo. The volvo bumped a bit forward. I was driving away slowly and the volvo was backing out as if nothing happened (Nothing happened too.). Later I found out that modern cars have automatic brakes when backing out  so thats what caused the effect of me thinking that I hit the car (I felt nothing in my own car).  When I got home that day I had a panic attack and I thought the worst: The guy noted down my license plate and the police will come after me. My dad tried to calm me down but it was near impossible, my entire day was fucked. Few days after that I managed to calm down. No visible damage on my car.

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks later something similar happened, but the feeling was much much worse. I went to a restaurant with my friend. As we all left, I got in my car and was backing out again. The exhaust hit a stone so I heard a loud bang. I knew at that point that nothing happened, so I stayed calm. When I was on my way home I saw a shit ton of ambulance and police cars driving so thats where I started to freak out again. I thought again that I hit someone while I didnt notice but the rational part of me knew that this is not possible, but the ""OCD"" part of me just made it so much worse than it actually is.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not avoid driving as I need to use my car few times a week but I am not enjoying it either as I am constantly with fear behind the wheel and I am sick of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do at this point.

**Context:**

I’m 17 years old and have been diagnosed with OCD for the last couple of years. Originally, it was thought to be just pure-o with mainly violent thoughts (I’m gonna hurt someone, I’m a menace to society, etc.) But everyday I’m learning that things I consider “normal” are actually OCD related, and I’m learning that OCD is at this point my entire life.

**What I’m facing right now:**

I’ve always questioned my sexuality, ever since fifth grade. I’m a male, and have believed that I’ve had attraction to other males in some shape or form. It’s always changing, I either have the sudden realization that I’m gay, and go a while like that but then I slowly move back to liking women (it’s more complex, but that’s a good way to put it in short).

t2_2s7eki9f,"2 years ago I was certain this was POCD. It started when I got the random intrusive thought “could I be a pedofile?”, of course the answer was no but I needed 100% proof, had a major panic attack, started checking my groin for signs of arousal, blah blah blah you get the jist I was the stereotypical POCD victim. However now it’s almost indistinguishable from pedophilia.

It got bad when I saw this kid in a movie and thought “oh he looks good” then freaked out. What’s worse is that I got a groinal response from this and mistook what I believe was anxiety for signs of arousal. Typical of OCD sufferers, I started obsessing about this question “what if I have a crush on this boy” and began testing for groinal responses. Naturally they got more intense to the point where I started masturbating to the groinal responses because I felt like that was the only way to make them go away. 

They became more intense developing into now being full on erections. My obsessions with OCD have come and gone. Usually they shift whenever my POCD switches from one child to another, and once they’ve switched I never have any symptoms from the previous subjects. This is different though because I genuinely thinks this kid looks good but not in a sexual way at all I just think he has a nice face. It’s the same way as me appreciating a same sex guy’s beauty without wanting to fuck him. But these erections are almost immediate now, I’ve programmed my brain to be into this, and now the arousal won’t go away. Lately I’ve gone a week of trying not to test in my head for arousal and committing compulsions and usually my true heterosexual sexuality starts to return. But then whenever I test again I always begin to get an erection. I had a recent episode when I was masturbating to porn when I got the thought “this probably wouldn’t be as good as masturbating to that kid” and lo and behold I got more aroused at that moment and finished to him because at this point, I really don’t fucking care. I don’t want to do anything sexual with this kid because I find nothing sexual about him, but this arousal is too strong and I can’t escape.

The thing is this kid is only 3 years you ger than me which medically woouldn’t make me a pedofile. He’d be a high school freshman, and at school I never pay attention to freshmen nor have I ever had a crush on one except for when I was one. I’ve also had a bunch of relationships throughout my POCD theme and they were all great. I’ve also never been the guy to get aroused super easily by girls, apart from porn, usually I have to get to know them first or make some sort of physical contact with them to be really aroused; and then once I’m in a relationship with a girl I get aroused like instantly when I start thinking of them. There are some days though when my 17 year old labido is in overdrive and I get aroused more frequently but usually I’m pretty chill.

So given this information is it even paying attention to any of this? Even if I were genuinely sexually attracted to this kid, it’s only ONE kid and I’m still sexually attracted to girls. My meds also make it really hard to tell if this is OCD because they have drastically reduced the frequency of intrusive thoughts so my POCD is only triggered by testing on this kid. The cycle usually goes: check for arousal by bringing up an image in my head, get a groinal response along with other arousal symptoms, freak out, and if I go to check my groin I may end up just masturbating.

I had childhood OCDs of handwashing and the superstition of not stepping on sidewalk cracks. I also had strange magical ideas like if the phone doesn't ring in the next 30 minutes my mother will die.

However, one of the biggest ways that OCD has impacted my life is in sexuality. Since 8 years old I have had intrusive thoughts of humiliating myself. It wasn't all the time but I would go through phases of being aroused by some form of humiliation. For example, at age 9 there was a few months when I was going to the bathroom in the front yard getting excited by the idea that people were watching me. It continued until my older sister came home from school one day and said that boys in her grade were asking her why her brother went to the bathroom outside like a dog. I tried to deny I had been doing that, but I knew I had been caught and had to stop. Although admittedly I felt an erotic urge to keep doing it.

At age 13 I invented a game to play alone in my bedroom of roleplaying that I was being held hostage by a criminal gang who had tied me up. I would put my arms behind my back and pretend to be helpless as I struggled against the imaginary ropes. This was very arousing for me.

Toward the end of my teen years I developed HOCD (I didn't know that's what it was called at the time). I had to stop watching baseball games because of the obsession I had of staring at the butts of the players. I knew I wasn't gay, but I could not stop looking at them like that.

Most of my sexual dreams involve humiliation: usually exhibitionism (sph) or crossdressing.

I read a lot about sexual fetishes but I can't clearly distinguish in my mind the difference between a sexual fetish and an OCD like HOCD, POCD, or TOCD. With my background of childhood OCD the line feels so blurred for me in what's a fetish versus what's a product of OCD or perhaps all of it is OCD?

The root of the problem: I'm a humanities student. I've always been a gifted reader and analytical writer; in academic settings, I've casually excelled at extracting ideas from texts and structuring my own in kind. Recently, though, I've become convinced that my non-participation in STEMdom evidences some kind of (heretofore thinly concealed) cognitive defect. 

I can't program and I've never tried to learn. I wouldn't know my way around a difficult physics problem. While I'm quick with verbal logic, symbolic language, unfamiliar as it is, intimidates me. Every time I hear about some simple but pivotal scientific insight, I torture myself with counterfactual history: would I — had I been transplanted to the era of its original formulation —  have dreamed it up myself? If not, I must be a step from idiocy, after all. 

And so goes the self-flagellation. 

The more I think about how little I've engaged with these disciplines, the less worth I see in the depth of my engagement with my own. So what?

Recently, I went through every TED-ed riddle — as well as countless ""quant interview""-type problems — and become abjectly miserable whenever I couldn't get one.

t2_shvrxfh,"So, it all started tonight when I wanted a snack. Asked my dad if we could open this bag of rice cakes he had. He reluctantly said yes, and so I eagerly grabbed the bag out of the cabinet. As I’m about to open it, though, I can feel there is air already coming out of it. I inspect the bag only to find that it is open partly (a few inches) along the back seal. This stresses me out, as I automatically think that they must’ve been tampered with and poisoned. I tell my dad they were already open, and he says to just throw them in our kitchen trash can. Which should’ve been good enough, but not when you have ridiculous tendencies to obsess. 

And so I thought, “well I can’t keep those rice cakes in the house, because what if I purposefully eat one later and then I will be poisoned and die”. My mind likes to trick me into thinking I will self-sabotage myself, so I start to panic a bit, unsure if I will be able to stand the “temptation” of having poisoned rice cakes in my house that I might impulsively eat at any moment. So I tell my dad we should throw the rice cakes in the outside trash, which happens to be a mini dumpster as we live at a small apartment complex. My dad replies that sure, I can go throw them out if I want. 

But this makes me panic too, because I “hate” dumpsters due to my paranoid fears that rabid animals like to congregate around dumpsters and I am near-phobic about having a run-in with rabies. So, I’m stuck between not wanting to go to the dumpster to throw out the rice cakes because I will probably be bit by a rabid animal if I go outside but if I don’t throw away the rice cakes tonight then the temptation of eating them will be too great and I will impulsively eat one and poison myself. 

At this point I am getting overwhelmed, and I feel that my dad is catching on to the outlandish-ness of my sudden rice cake fear. I then start having paranoid thoughts that if I don’t throw them out, my dad is going to sabotage me and feed me a rice cake while I sleep or crumble one up in one of our leftover food containers in the fridge so that I will be poisoned. I beg my dad to personally throw out the rice cakes tonight for me (I know, enabling family members is bad) and he eventually and reluctantly agrees. He tells me I have to go out with him to the dumpster though while he throws it away. I figure that this is actually a really good opportunity for some diy “exposure therapy” so I of course agree.

We go out to the dumpster, and he makes me peer inside, which I do and it’s all good. I’m mildly acting compulsive by enabling my own hyperawareness to scan the area around the dumpster to make sure any animals aren’t nearby. Well, the dumpster has these little handle things (I think where the dump truck picks them up at) on its sides and as we are walking away from the dumpster I start wondering if the little side handle on my side of the dumpster maybe had like a bat chilling on it or something and that I had touched it even though I’m almost sure I didn’t even touch the dumpster and even more sure there were no bats around...(I’ve had a preoccupation with finding bats in obscure places for a long time now).

Anyways, I don’t let myself go back to the dumpster, but I keep looking at it as we are walking back to the apartment. We go inside, and I can’t stop thinking about the damn dumpster, wanting to go ultra-compulsive and check the area around the dumpster and the side handle again to make sure there are no animals there. I just hate my brain lmao and I know this story is 1000% so extra but I wrote it completely honestly, including even the most ridiculous thoughts because those ridiculous thoughts are the real me and the way my brain operates.

t2_4a97q0kq,"Hi, I need an answer about this, sorry For my English I’m not native. I  have what I hope is HOCD over a year now. It all started in a weed trip. When I quitted weed, I recovered for like 5 months where my attraction for guys came back and I was normal again. Then i relapsed on the weed cause I thought I was fine again but thank to this the thoughts came back again and now I feel hopeless.

Anyway, the thing is that this year I cheated on my boyfriend with a GUY that I liked. We had a thing going on this summer and I felt sooooooo excited about it, happy , thrilled about life again ,  for having these affair., that there was no doubt about being a lesbian anymore because I was FEELING very happy, FEELING real excitement, FEELING real needs and desires of fucking the dude, not just THINKING about it. It reminded me of the feelings i had before the HOCD striked.  

We had sex a few times. The first ones were good . Until it stopped because HOCD CAME BACK and all that excitement for the guy was GONE. I swear that I went from feeling a lot to feel nothing for him like a switch when HOCD returned, because the thoughts of liking girls and not being true to myself were more present  in my mind. My mind (or me?!?) was telling me that I was forcing my crush on the guy and that I really wasn’t attracted to him because he’s not a girl. 

So my question is, HOCD is that powerful that can take your feelings away like that? Or am I really gay and really never felt nothing for the guy and I was lying to myself? What were all those real feelings and emotions then? Mere illusions ? Lies? Am I doomed to feel nothing towards anybody but girls? ( fun fact: still not recalling ever feeling sthng romantic for a girl ) I really want to know what u think about this.


This makes me sooooo confused, right now I’m very deep down in HOCD, feeling like its veeery real and that I’m gay and repressing it. I’m very deppresed again because of this but then I read gay people testimonies that say that they were depressed too when they realized :(",Does HOCD takes your feelings and emotions away?,OCD,3,ckznvp,False,"Hi, I need an answer about this, sorry For my English I’m not native.

t2_4hqqxxne,"First off, I’m a fourteen year old boy. I’m in my sophomore year of highschool. School starts for me on September 4th I think. I’m also going to be fifteen in September so I’m getting closer to the age a person can actually be considered a pedophile if they are attracted to children. Let me explain my situation. For some odd reason I have three fears. Here’s all of them: fear that I am a pedophile, fear that I am bisexual and fear that I’m transgender. The two that bother me the most are the transgender and pedophile fears. Because I obviously don’t want to be a pedophile who’s attracted to prepubescent children and I also don’t want to be transgender because that means I’d be more comfortable as a girl and that possibility is scary. Being gay I could live with because at least it’s not like having an unhealthy attraction to children or anything like that. It’s just all of these things feel so damn real. It really feels as if I am these things and that really bums me out and has me down all the time. If I really am a pedophile than I’ll do the right thing and get the help I need. I don’t think I want to do anything to children but I’m not to sure. Maybe I do? I’m confused. Maybe it’s making me believe I do. I find children to be quite annoying when they yell. And honestly I wish they would shut the hell up because they disturb my peace and quite in the morning. I don’t hate children though. I mean I want them to be happy and enjoy themselves and have a good time and whatever. Because they are children and I remember what it was like to be young like them. I mean I’m still young I think. But they are clearly younger. I imagine these scenarios that I think I could be in with a child. I do it everyday pretty often to. One of the scenarios was me in a car and a child goes on my lap and I like it in the scenario. It didn’t actually happen, I think I do it to see how I’d feel if it happened. I don’t know why but typing this made me kind of aroused. I’m afraid to admit it. I did imagine it a little to I think. I’m confused. Even if I was a pedophile I wouldn’t act on my desire. I know I wouldn’t. Not sure if I even have a desire or not. I really do feel like one. Even transgender I feel like that’s real to some extent. It doesn’t feel that real right now but it has felt real before. The gay one feels real too. I know I’m not gay but I do fear being bisexual which could be true I don’t know. When I’m horny and want to jack off I don’t think I think about children or babies or some shit. I worry about all of these things everyday. Well not all of them everyday. Most days I focus on just one than others I’ll think about another. I just fear being a pedophile. Am I a pedophile if I like the word prepubescent? Because I just like the word I dunno why. Maybe it’s because I am a pedophile or something. I’m going to sleep now, I just felt like posting this before going to sleep. I just want answers. I feel like I’ll get aroused if I see a child in a bathing suit or something. Im worried I might like undeveloped bodies like actual really young children. I worry I might like a child emotionally and connect with them. Even though non of these things happen. I want to TRUELY understand what it means to be a pedophile. What is it pedophiles like about children. Is it their behavior or their appearance. I don’t know. I want a girl who’s energetic fun has a complete personality unlike me. I want her to be the opposite of me basically. Because opposites attract I guess. I want her to be cute pretty and maybe even sexy. I know this is weird but I’d rather have a pretty cute girl than a girl who’s just sexy. Not sure why.

I don’t even want to get a girlfriend because of this. Because if I turn out to actually be a pedophile than the relationship will obviously not work.

I do have an idea of what triggered it but I don’t feel like writing this anymore because I’m tired. Also I don’t mind honest answers with this.

Hope someone responds.",POCD pedophilia,OCD,2,cy6my2,False,"First off, I’m a fourteen year old boy. I’m in my sophomore year of highschool. School starts for me on September 4th I think. I’m also going to be fifteen in September so I’m getting closer to the age a person can actually be considered a pedophile if they are attracted to children. Let me explain my situation. For some odd reason I have three fears. Here’s all of them: fear that I am a pedophile, fear that I am bisexual and fear that I’m transgender. The two that bother me the most are the transgender and pedophile fears. Because I obviously don’t want to be a pedophile who’s attracted to prepubescent children and I also don’t want to be transgender because that means I’d be more comfortable as a girl and that possibility is scary. Being gay I could live with because at least it’s not like having an unhealthy attraction to children or anything like that. It’s just all of these things feel so damn real. It really feels as if I am these things and that really bums me out and has me down all the time. If I really am a pedophile than I’ll do the right thing and get the help I need. I don’t think I want to do anything to children but I’m not to sure. Maybe I do? I’m confused. Maybe it’s making me believe I do. I find children to be quite annoying when they yell. And honestly I wish they would shut the hell up because they disturb my peace and quite in the morning. I don’t hate children though. I mean I want them to be happy and enjoy themselves and have a good time and whatever. Because they are children and I remember what it was like to be young like them. I mean I’m still young I think. But they are clearly younger. I imagine these scenarios that I think I could be in with a child. I do it everyday pretty often to. One of the scenarios was me in a car and a child goes on my lap and I like it in the scenario. It didn’t actually happen, I think I do it to see how I’d feel if it happened. I don’t know why but typing this made me kind of aroused. I’m afraid to admit it. I did imagine it a little to I think. I’m confused. Even if I was a pedophile I wouldn’t act on my desire. I know I wouldn’t. Not sure if I even have a desire or not. I really do feel like one. Even transgender I feel like that’s real to some extent. It doesn’t feel that real right now but it has felt real before. The gay one feels real too. I know I’m not gay but I do fear being bisexual which could be true I don’t know. When I’m horny and want to jack off I don’t think I think about children or babies or some shit. I worry about all of these things everyday. Well not all of them everyday. Most days I focus on just one than others I’ll think about another. I just fear being a pedophile. Am I a pedophile if I like the word prepubescent? Because I just like the word I dunno why. Maybe it’s because I am a pedophile or something. I’m going to sleep now, I just felt like posting this before going to sleep. I just want answers. I feel like I’ll get aroused if I see a child in a bathing suit or something. Im worried I might like undeveloped bodies like actual really young children. I worry I might like a child emotionally and connect with them. Even though non of these things happen. I want to TRUELY understand what it means to be a pedophile. What is it pedophiles like about children. Is it their behavior or their appearance. I don’t know. I want a girl who’s energetic fun has a complete personality unlike me. I want her to be the opposite of me basically. Because opposites attract I guess. I want her to be cute pretty and maybe even sexy. I know this is weird but I’d rather have a pretty cute girl than a girl who’s just sexy. Not sure why.

Around 10 years ago I had an intrusive thought that persisted and developed into Pure O. It lead to broader OCD and a complete breakdown that changed the course of my life.

Today I can say I rarely if ever have any intrusive or obsessive thoughts. Hopefully my story can help others with a faster recovery.


It began with a single thought that spiralled out of control. I was a very normal happy guy, above average in looks, personality, kind and thoughtful, very modest too :) 

I won't dwell on the intrusive thoughts, it was the usual... violent, sexual in nature, very disturbing things which were beyond comprehension. I felt horrible, insecure, and drained all the time. i.e. peodophilia, relative being mutilated, questioning my identity, my mind had unravelled there were no limits.
I couldn't leave the house without repuslive random intrusions.

A severe intrusion would last about a week in my mind, along with endless rumination to try to make sense and put things right.

I developed a sort of ritual OCD alongside to try and cope with the thoughts, i.e. repeating certain names, counting numbers, rethinking the opposite. At my peak, I shut myself off from the world and fell into the abyss, I had lost control of my mind, life was not worth living anymore.

I reneged restless day and nights, ruminating on thoughts, dissecting, analysing every moment.

I started to self medicate with 5htp and supplements but nothing helped. I later on sought help from various psychologist, CBT and ultimately a psychiatrist. 


What helped me get through this?

Not avoiding life and carrying on as normal as possible, it's fine to not feel great but don't deprive yourself of moments and experiences you'd enjoy.

You are the same person, you are just reacting to unpleasant thoughts.
 
Simply expose yourself to situations as normal which cause the anxiety, try not to react to them. I know how hard this was for me, but I promise you do not give these intrusive thoughts the time of you day.
If needed reduce any rituals or rumination by 5 mins each day, set a time slot and move on once you are done.

You must ACCEPT feeling anxious, just take a breath there's nothing you can do: ""I have a thought and feel axiety, yep so what?"" Take a moment to accept your state of mind and how you feel.

Most people have distressful thoughts but do not react to them, subconsciously their identity is intact. You are your own person, not a fictious thought or someone else's crime. No need to analyse or doubt yourself, it is a waste of time. Everyone is capable of doing bad things, but you are not one of them, acting on a thought is completely different, 20 years prior to OCD should indicate this so just relax.

I never once acted on any pure O thoughts.  People who are at a disposition of enacting disturbing thoughts would likely not worry about it at all, so it's good sign that you have them but totally unnecessary to keep going over them as we already established who you are as a person - pure O will not change this! 


Take steps to alleviate the anxiety, perhaps remove toxic people from your life, or triggers which may exacerbate, do something you might enjoy like a trip.

As mentioned previously reduce any rituals or rumination by 5 mins each day, set a time slot and move on. Take it easy, be kind to yourself and take a moment to rest if needed but don't deprive yourself from things you would enjoy. Try to remain social, even if you don't feel great. Don't worry about it this will pass just like a bad trip on LSD. 

They say time is the best healer. Some recover quicker than others. But there's plenty of time trust me so live in the present.

If you are in the the midst of your OCD let me tell you it gets better, your mind will eventually adjust to this bullshit and not care anymore, the intrusions will stop.

If you are having severe episodes regularly go to your GP, get a prescription of Paroxetine or Effexor to assist with your recovery. These were the most effective for me and I tried the whole counter. Almost half the population in America are on prescription. Have some CBT sessions to get a helpful outside perspective.


Scars do remain but the torment has parted, with just ocasional reminders of what it use to be like and how far I am from back then.

Feel free to ask any questions, I would be glad to help or provide advice. If there's a particular issue your struggling with, perhaps I can share a similar anecdote.

Peace","How I overcame Pure O, OCD",OCD,19,cy9uyn,False,"Background: 30/M/UK

Around 10 years ago I had an intrusive thought that persisted and developed into Pure O. It lead to broader OCD and a complete breakdown that changed the course of my life.

Today I can say I rarely if ever have any intrusive or obsessive thoughts. Hopefully my story can help others with a faster recovery.

I've tried searching online and I guess I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience to me or if this is related to OCD. I'm honestly kind of embarrassed so I haven't talked to my doctor about it but I feel like it's interfering a bit with my professional life, as crazy as that  sounds. 

Basically, ever since I was a kid I've been obsessed with scotch tape. I'll just play with it and put it between my fingers, and then throw it away once it loses its stick. We can't keep it in the house, so my boyfriend knows. At work, I can't keep tape on my desk but they have some in the meeting rooms so I'll go in there just to get a piece of tape. Like I said, this has been since I was a kid as long as I can remember. I've been diagnosed with OCD and anxiety for unrelated issues and i'm on 40mg of Prozac now but this obsession is still there. Is this related to OCD or something else? Has anyone had a similar experience?

t2_3p5b38db,"Hi all. Been a reader of this subreddit for a while but never posted until now. 

Ever since I can remember, I’ve combed through every interaction I have with someone and find ways I could have offended someone. Therapists did not seem to understand the level to which I do this and have just said I have anxiety, which I could never relate to (I mean, I could on some levels, but not with my obsessions about offending people—anxiety didn’t seem to scrape the surface). It’s only relatively recently (in the last two years) that I’ve come to realize that I think it’s OCD, but all examples I can find of this moral component online have to do with religion, and mine doesn’t have to do with religion at all—it’s more that I’ve deeply harmed someone’s life through insulting them by something I’ve said, and that I’m a bad person because of it.

For example, last night I was hanging out with my friend, who is polyamorous. I got a little drunk and asked them about what it’s like to be polyamorous. From an objective standpoint, they (they’re nonbinary) didn’t seem to be offended and shared with me openly, but I keep thinking they’re secretly angry and think I’ve oppressed them. 

This is just one example, but I collect these instances and replay them over and over, and I can’t seem to let them go, and they all pile up as evidence that I’m wreaking havoc everywhere I go, and I get the unbelievably strong urge to apologize or ask if I’ve offended them, even if the occurrence was years ago. I’m usually able to stop myself from acting in these compulsions, because I’ve found that it alienates people and also that it doesn’t get rid of my thoughts.

I can’t keep doing this. All examples I find online don’t apply to me and it’s all just so lonely (and I don’t have insurance and live in a very rural area so therapy is a bit out of the question).

I have so many different fears it's really frustrating (intrusive thoughts about harming, cheating, existential, doing something inappropriate suddenly, am I a bad person, and the list goes on...).

I've read about erp with pure o, especially with harm OCD. There are a lot of ERP exercises that involve a patient being in the situations they fear and kind of doing the things they fear. For example, if someone fears they might hurt someone or themselves, there is an exercise where they hold a knife on someone's or themselves throat. Or they fear they might touch someone in an inappropriate way, so the exercise is to hug a lot. These kind of exercises don't sound good to me at all.

t2_44x3ti8l,"I'm a 29 year old male with a really nasty history with porn/ sex addiction. After many failed attempts to better myself, and after a severe suicidal ideation I had yesterday, I've decided I have to take in my dedication to really get over this.

TRIGGER WARNING: This includes some graphic/ extreme kinks. Please proceed with caution.

I suffer from severe OCD. I go through phases when it barely affects my life and phases where it completely takes over and everywhere in between. I'm gonna try to keep this all as short as possible, but knowing me, I'm gonna fail at that.

I started my porn viewing when I was 13. I would sneak it on my dad's computer and computers at the local youth center. I also started cybering around the age of 15, and it's been the cybersex that has been my biggest addiction. Ever since then, I've always been obsessed with using fantasies and scenarios to get women to cum. 

I started using r/gonewild and other subreddits to find willing participants to talk dirty to. I started noticing my kinks getting more extreme. I've been told that this desensitization is like building of tolerance to a drug. I found myself desensitized to urine play and even scat. It was always about knowing that I could use these kinks to get women to cum that really excited me. I guess it made me feel ""special"" or ""wanted"".

Eventually I got into CNC (consensual non-consent, meaning that the a submissive gives consent to a Dom to enact a rape). Now I'm about to use a bunch of ""he"" pronouns for someone who at the time identified as female and later came out as trans. I met this guy on reddit on one of the CNC subs. He actually lived in the same state as me. So we met up and formed a relationship. We're no longer a couple. Once he came out as trans, I tried for 2 months to get it to work, but I couldn't do it. I'm just not attracted to men. We still live together and are working towards transitioning to a close friendship.

Me and this guy would get involved in some extreme play, even some CNC. He gave me permission to ""use"" him however I felt. We had a communicated safeword and everything. He told me he wanted me to use him no even if he wasn't ""in the mood"", which lead to a lot of forced anal penetration, which he had told me on quite a few occasions that he liked. He also hated my cybering and porn viewing habits. With the exception of a couple of slip ups, I gave up cybering but kept viewing porn behind his back.

Then one morning after one of these sessions, he stormed out of the room. He had a panic attack and told me that there were several times during our sessions that he wanted to use his safeword but couldn't. Not because I would cover his mouth or force his face into a pillow, but because he's an abuse victim. His dad was a narcissistic asshole that made him afraid of confrontation and his brother sexually assaulted him when he was 7. 

Knowing all of this made me sick to my stomach. To any of you reading this that don't already know, if your partner is an abuse victim, you have to be extremely sensitive to any non-verbal queues, even if the play in question involves your partner pretending to not want it. Break character, ruin the mood slightly. I don't care. Don't make the mistakes I did! This made me feel sick and like I was no better than an intentional rapist. It made me realize that my extreme kinks were unhealthy and that they came from desensitization from porn. I made a stab at making a recovery, to get myself away from these kinks and back to a normal sex life. If I really have any of these kinks, they'll stick, but they'll be explored in healthier environments and settings. 

I installed Forever Accountable (highly recommended, btw). I curbed my porn addiction slightly. My viewing habits went down dramatically. I made my ex my accountability partner. But I'd always search for ways around it. Joining vaguely sexual Facebook groups, looking at memes, music videos, etc. I started seeing a therapist, Mark. He proved to be amazingly helpful. But then my awesome insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield) decided not to pay him, so he cut me off after about 6 sessions. This left me devastated.

Eventually I ended up breaking up with my ex not just because I'm not attracted to men... But because I wanted to get back into cybering. And I did exactly that. I guess mentally I figured ""fuck it, nothing's going right anyways."" I removed my ex as an accountability partner and instead had a close friend of mine do it. And he was WAY more lenient. 

Over the next month I used reddit to once again seek out women to talk dirty to. I kept promising myself I'd stop once I got bored with it, but that never happened.

Now... What I'm about to say is incredibly controversial and troubling. I feel so fucked up typing this, but it's the biggest motivation I now have to get myself over this. I have a project I'm working on for my YouTube channel where I am going to cover American popular music history. I was reading this book on New Wave and one of the bands they covered was Bow Wow Wow. On their introductory page was photo of a naked girl, shot from the back, not private bits showing. Well, turns out as I read on I discover that the girl is the lead singer and she was 14 at the time the photo was taken. This was a week ago that I saw this.

My brain would not stop obsessing about underage girls. I want to make this clear, I HAVE NOT ACTED OUT ON THESE OBSESSIONS! But I'm absolutely terrified that I'm going to. Yesterday, my brain kept saying ""you should go on a site where you can pursue these girls"" and I kept screaming internally at myself. Then finally, I got extremely close to doing it, stopped, and had a mental breakdown. For the first time in my life, I self harmed and contemplated suicide. Then, in this horrible, anxious, shitty mood, I had to go to work. And during my breaks I kept looking up how to deal with these uncomfortable thoughts.

What I found is that pedophillic thoughts can come from our good old friend desensitization. I'm not okay exploring this and its fucking time I took this problem 1,000% seriously. I'm hoping I'm not a legit pedophile. I know there's pedophiles that don't act on their urges. I also know that it could also be my OCD doing this to me, but Shaq don't play that game.

But I'm reaching out. I can't do this alone. I've started looking for a new therapist and I'm legit done with this shit.",How could my OCD be contributing to my sex/ porn addiction?,OCD,9,cyftke,False,"I'm a 29 year old male with a really nasty history with porn/ sex addiction. After many failed attempts to better myself, and after a severe suicidal ideation I had yesterday, I've decided I have to take in my dedication to really get over this.

TRIGGER WARNING: This includes some graphic/ extreme kinks. Please proceed with caution.

I suffer from severe OCD. I go through phases when it barely affects my life and phases where it completely takes over and everywhere in between. I'm gonna try to keep this all as short as possible, but knowing me, I'm gonna fail at that.

I started my porn viewing when I was 13. I would sneak it on my dad's computer and computers at the local youth center. I also started cybering around the age of 15, and it's been the cybersex that has been my biggest addiction. Ever since then, I've always been obsessed with using fantasies and scenarios to get women to cum. 

I started using r/gonewild and other subreddits to find willing participants to talk dirty to. I started noticing my kinks getting more extreme. I've been told that this desensitization is like building of tolerance to a drug. I found myself desensitized to urine play and even scat. It was always about knowing that I could use these kinks to get women to cum that really excited me. I guess it made me feel ""special"" or ""wanted"".

Eventually I got into CNC (consensual non-consent, meaning that the a submissive gives consent to a Dom to enact a rape). Now I'm about to use a bunch of ""he"" pronouns for someone who at the time identified as female and later came out as trans. I met this guy on reddit on one of the CNC subs. He actually lived in the same state as me. So we met up and formed a relationship. We're no longer a couple. Once he came out as trans, I tried for 2 months to get it to work, but I couldn't do it. I'm just not attracted to men. We still live together and are working towards transitioning to a close friendship.

Me and this guy would get involved in some extreme play, even some CNC. He gave me permission to ""use"" him however I felt. We had a communicated safeword and everything. He told me he wanted me to use him no even if he wasn't ""in the mood"", which lead to a lot of forced anal penetration, which he had told me on quite a few occasions that he liked. He also hated my cybering and porn viewing habits. With the exception of a couple of slip ups, I gave up cybering but kept viewing porn behind his back.

Then one morning after one of these sessions, he stormed out of the room. He had a panic attack and told me that there were several times during our sessions that he wanted to use his safeword but couldn't. Not because I would cover his mouth or force his face into a pillow, but because he's an abuse victim. His dad was a narcissistic asshole that made him afraid of confrontation and his brother sexually assaulted him when he was 7. 

Knowing all of this made me sick to my stomach. To any of you reading this that don't already know, if your partner is an abuse victim, you have to be extremely sensitive to any non-verbal queues, even if the play in question involves your partner pretending to not want it. Break character, ruin the mood slightly. I don't care. Don't make the mistakes I did! This made me feel sick and like I was no better than an intentional rapist. It made me realize that my extreme kinks were unhealthy and that they came from desensitization from porn. I made a stab at making a recovery, to get myself away from these kinks and back to a normal sex life. If I really have any of these kinks, they'll stick, but they'll be explored in healthier environments and settings. 

I installed Forever Accountable (highly recommended, btw). I curbed my porn addiction slightly. My viewing habits went down dramatically. I made my ex my accountability partner. But I'd always search for ways around it. Joining vaguely sexual Facebook groups, looking at memes, music videos, etc. I started seeing a therapist, Mark. He proved to be amazingly helpful. But then my awesome insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield) decided not to pay him, so he cut me off after about 6 sessions. This left me devastated.

Eventually I ended up breaking up with my ex not just because I'm not attracted to men... But because I wanted to get back into cybering. And I did exactly that. I guess mentally I figured ""fuck it, nothing's going right anyways."" I removed my ex as an accountability partner and instead had a close friend of mine do it. And he was WAY more lenient. 

Over the next month I used reddit to once again seek out women to talk dirty to. I kept promising myself I'd stop once I got bored with it, but that never happened.

Now... What I'm about to say is incredibly controversial and troubling. I feel so fucked up typing this, but it's the biggest motivation I now have to get myself over this. I have a project I'm working on for my YouTube channel where I am going to cover American popular music history. I was reading this book on New Wave and one of the bands they covered was Bow Wow Wow. On their introductory page was photo of a naked girl, shot from the back, not private bits showing. Well, turns out as I read on I discover that the girl is the lead singer and she was 14 at the time the photo was taken. This was a week ago that I saw this.

My brain would not stop obsessing about underage girls. I want to make this clear, I HAVE NOT ACTED OUT ON THESE OBSESSIONS! But I'm absolutely terrified that I'm going to. Yesterday, my brain kept saying ""you should go on a site where you can pursue these girls"" and I kept screaming internally at myself. Then finally, I got extremely close to doing it, stopped, and had a mental breakdown. For the first time in my life, I self harmed and contemplated suicide. Then, in this horrible, anxious, shitty mood, I had to go to work. And during my breaks I kept looking up how to deal with these uncomfortable thoughts.

What I found is that pedophillic thoughts can come from our good old friend desensitization. I'm not okay exploring this and its fucking time I took this problem 1,000% seriously. I'm hoping I'm not a legit pedophile. I know there's pedophiles that don't act on their urges. I also know that it could also be my OCD doing this to me, but Shaq don't play that game. I'm not taking the risk of this NOT being my OCD. And it honestly terrifies me to death.

There's my story and its not even everything. I'm shaking at some of the reactions I'm going to get. I'm scared I'm going to get ridiculed for what I've done, especially that last part. But I'm reaching out. I can't do this alone. I've started looking for a new therapist and I'm legit done with this shit.

t2_7w01bf3,"This is Google's description:

OCD often centers on themes such as a fear of germs or the need to arrange objects in a specific manner. Symptoms usually begin gradually and vary throughout life.

People may experience:

Behavioral: agitation, compulsive behavior, compulsive hoarding, hypervigilance, impulsivity, meaningless repetition of own words, persistent repetition of words or actions, repetitive movements, ritualistic behavior, or social isolation

Mood: anxiety, apprehension, guilt, or panic attack

Psychological: depression or fear

Also common: food aversion, nightmares, or repeatedly going over thoughts



I have had pretty much every one of those symptoms except nightmares and fear of germs, but they are not necessarily consistently happening all the time. Some symptoms are very frequent others not so much, but I've experienced all of them in one capacity or another; I am probably experiencing these symptoms more mildly than others may have I'm not sure. The symptoms are so far only minimally interfering with my quality of life.

I have this really weird thing with the door. One single time I shut the side door of our house on the way out and it didn't shut right. I immediately saw it didn't shut right and closed it right. Our 3 huge dogs didn't escape, nothing happened. Since then (~2years ago), I cannot leave the house without checking the door anywhere from 2-10 times. Some times (rarely) I have even closed the door, checked it again, got in the car, got out of the car, checked it again, got back into the car and pulled down the driveway and down the street,  turned around and went back to check it again, each time it it's totally soundly locked and not accidentally open. This behavior feels very much out of my control; sometimes it's worse than others, but I always check it at least 2 or 3 times no matter what. It drives my wife nuts....

One more relevant detail. I was in a bad car accident 6 years ago and broke my femur. The 1/2lb metal rod they used to fix my leg was defective or something and caused me intense, horrific pain for several years. I finally convinced the surgeons it was causing me problems and they begrudgingly took it out. That was about 2 years ago. I still had pain after that, but it was less. I downgraded from prescription pain pills, to mostly kratom (with occasional hydrocodone) . After a while I noticed I was kind of accidentally addicted to opioids and it was probably causing some of my pain (see: opioid induced hyperalgesia), so I started buprenorphine.  I feel a lot better and more stable and have minimal pain now, but I still have the psychological baggage of my 6 year traumatic experience with the wreck, the rod, and the ""medicine"". First my mental illness was anxiety, then depression added on after a while, now I'm worried its progressed to OCD. I think it's all because of the the trauma; it's been hard on both me and my wife living like this for so long.


-Will it get worse from here? Is Schizophrenia next!?
-Can I reverse it or employ some preemptive behavior modification that will slow the progression of the disease? 
-Do I even sound like I have actual OCD or is it possible just a side affect of the traumatic experience?

 It's really starting to concern me and I'm hoping someone can share their experience of recognizing they had this mental illness and how they went about overcoming it. I'm so scared.

I have posted way more about this and my other obsessions on tons and tons of my previous accounts but I deactivated them and got rid of them because I think I have like electronic ocd. Like I guess it has to be perfect. If something really small goes wrong than itll bother me so much we’re I’ll delete the account and make a new one. And the cycle repeats itself over and over. So I’m going to delete this account eventually too, because well... I think I may have ocd. I have other obsessions like fear that I am bisexual and a fear that I’m transgender. The fear isn’t actually gay, because I know I’m not gay deep down because I love woman and I’ve had crushes on woman. But I do worry about being bisexual. And I worry about being transgender. But it’s not like I showed any signs of being transgender when I was a lot younger. There where no signs as far as I’m concerned. And I know deep down I’m not transgender too. But I still worry about it regardless because I don’t know. It’s a fear I guess. I’m happy as a male and don’t think I want to switch to boobies or a va-J-J anytime soon. I like having a tube coming out my body and shit. I did experience something like gender dysphoria, but I don’t think it was gender dysphoria looking back at it now. It was probably just me being extremely uncomfortable. Basically what I think happened was, I was fearing being transgender so I went into the bathroom looked in the mirror and straight up gropped my man boobies and I was being really rough with myself. I did it to kind of test if I’d be happier with boobs, so I tried pretending I had boobs and gropped myself. I even like grabbed my ass and shook it as hard as I possibly could. When I came out the bathroom that’s when I experienced the discomfort that I really thought at the time was gender dysphoria. But now that I look back it probably wasn’t. It was probably just real discomfort over what I fucking did to myself. Like I was lying down after and felt uncomfortable and just, weird I guess. I was really rough so maybe I was alittle shocked or something I don’t know. This is about POCD though. Right now, I don’t really feel like I’m a pedophile. I mean I do a little bit because I guess that’s what POCD does. It makes you feel like a pedo. But after a lot of thinking about all of this, I guess that’s ruminating, right? I am just choosing to not worry about it. It’s really hard not to worry because I do feel like a pedophile and I want answers to whatever this is. I’ve been on this reddit thing a lot today thinking about pedophilia. I’ve never worried about being a pedophile before. And I know I can’t just magically be a pedophile. It’s something that your born with. But despite knowing that. I can’t help but still worry. The reason why I’m posting again is because I’ve noticed that even when I’m not worrying about being a pedophile I still can’t help but think about the kids outside playing. I might just be sub subconsciously thinking about it or it’s in the back of my mind at all times or something. Like I was in the kitchen eating some junk food and there’s kids screaming a lot outside just being kids. And even though at the time I wasn’t necessarily worrying about being a pedo because I’m choosing not to, I couldn’t help but just pay attention to the kids screaming outside my house. I wasn’t fantasizing about them sexually and I don’t want to anyway. I wasn’t thinking about them romantically also. It was just, whenever they were screaming my focus went to their screams. Sometimes I even waited for them to scream. I don’t get why. Like it was hard doing what I was doing because my attention shifted to the children screaming. Now I know it doesn’t make me a pedophile but still. I get urges sometimes to. I don’t get urges to do anything to children or to touch them or whatever. Like I don’t want to molest them or anything. I don’t want to do that to them. It’s just whenever I’m in the kitchen looking for food in my fridge and there’s children outside playing I get an urge. I don’t know what the urge is actually. Like I don’t know what kind of urge it is. It’s just an urge, it’s weird. I have a window in my kitchen so it could be an urge to go by the window or something. I’m not sure if it’s an urge to look at the children outside or what. Whenever I get the urge I kind of fight it and sometimes I just leave the kitchen because I hate how it makes me feel like it’s a pedophile urge. I never worried about being a pedophile before, but than again pedophilia develops around this age I think. Or is it something people are born with? I don’t know. Are these Ocd kind of urges or pedophile urges. I obviously don’t want to be a pedophile. Nobody does. It’s horrible. I don’t want to have an abnormal attraction to kids. But why do I get urges. I don’t get an urge to open my door walk outside and molest a child, he’ll no. I can’t describe it really. It’s hard. It might just be an urge to look out the window or something. Sometimes I think I get an urge to be silent and and listen outside. I’m not sure if I’ve gotten urge like that actually. I think I had one like that once. I just feel like a pedophile and I don’t like. I won’t act on it or anything and I don’t think I even want to either. If I am a pedophile I’ll 100% get help from someone and find better attractions or whatever. It’s just the urges I get. Is that ocd or what? And like I said, there’s children outside playing a lot. And one of the children has fucking Tourette’s and can’t shut the actual fuck up, seriously. I don’t mean to be rude or anything. I really shouldn’t because I got mental issues myself. I just wish they could put something tight over his mouth so he can be quiet. It’s just whenever those children scream especially the girls I can’t help but just focus on their screaming. Maybe I’m paranoid or something. Maybe I’m thinking about it in the back of my mind. I’m pretty sure it’s always in the back of my mind. Maybe their screams are bothering me. I did used to worry about being aroused by their screams so maybe that’s why. Has anyone with POCD had something similar happen to them. Does this relate to anyone with this type of ocd???",POCD,OCD,0,cyhdt8,False,"I’m a fourteen year old male. Now I already posted a couple posts about this same topic on this account. I have posted way more about this and my other obsessions on tons and tons of my previous accounts but I deactivated them and got rid of them because I think I have like electronic ocd. Like I guess it has to be perfect. If something really small goes wrong than itll bother me so much we’re I’ll delete the account and make a new one. And the cycle repeats itself over and over. So I’m going to delete this account eventually too, because well... I think I may have ocd. I have other obsessions like fear that I am bisexual and a fear that I’m transgender. The fear isn’t actually gay, because I know I’m not gay deep down because I love woman and I’ve had crushes on woman. But I do worry about being bisexual. And I worry about being transgender. But it’s not like I showed any signs of being transgender when I was a lot younger. There where no signs as far as I’m concerned. And I know deep down I’m not transgender too. But I still worry about it regardless because I don’t know. It’s a fear I guess. I’m happy as a male and don’t think I want to switch to boobies or a va-J-J anytime soon. I like having a tube coming out my body and shit. I did experience something like gender dysphoria, but I don’t think it was gender dysphoria looking back at it now. It was probably just me being extremely uncomfortable. Basically what I think happened was, I was fearing being transgender so I went into the bathroom looked in the mirror and straight up gropped my man boobies and I was being really rough with myself. I did it to kind of test if I’d be happier with boobs, so I tried pretending I had boobs and gropped myself. I even like grabbed my ass and shook it as hard as I possibly could. When I came out the bathroom that’s when I experienced the discomfort that I really thought at the time was gender dysphoria. But now that I look back it probably wasn’t. It was probably just real discomfort over what I fucking did to myself. Like I was lying down after and felt uncomfortable and just, weird I guess. I was really rough so maybe I was alittle shocked or something I don’t know. This is about POCD though. Right now, I don’t really feel like I’m a pedophile. I mean I do a little bit because I guess that’s what POCD does. It makes you feel like a pedo. But after a lot of thinking about all of this, I guess that’s ruminating, right?

It was my first time really trying ERP-style treatment, and I felt like after a really hard fight I had come out a winner. I felt on top of the world. I felt cured.

Then, I had a new compulsion related to my original one. I thought, hey, this feels bad but I just beat the big one so time will pass and I'll beat this one too. However a few hours later, before I could even register what I was doing, I gave in to the new compulsion.

t2_4e9h2qi1,"This post isn't purely about OCD but I'll start there.

I think I have contamination OCD. If something is ""dirty"" I can't/won't touch it. If I do I will keep from touching anything else until I wash my hands. I also try to make sure it doesn't touch anything else to keep it from ""spreading"".

I can remember having these thoughts back when I was maybe 5-8 years old. I'm not 100% sure how it started in my case but I have a theory. I think it started off with something rational that just got way out of hand. Here's an analogy. Maybe when I was younger I got some crap on a toy. So it was obviously dirty so I cleaned it and threw it in the box with the rest. Then the thought surfaced that maybe I didnt clean it well. Now they could all be dirty. I wasn't just gonna throw them away so I kept them but the problem is the thoughts stayed and over time the ""contamination"" spread.

It got to the point that I stopped asking for gifts for christmas, birthdays, etc and buying things because they would just get contaminated and I wouldn't want them anymore. This in itself was very bad for me psychologically. I couldn't do much of anything and even my clothes always felt contaminated so I took that ""feeling"" everywhere I went.

Eventually i got so angry and frustrated that I blew up at home as I basically had no life. I was admitted to a mental hospital and treated for psychosis. I told the doctor I thought I had OCD and that's the reason I blew up. I was embarassed so I didnt share the details so I understand why he couldn't diagnose me with OCD but come on psychosis? Even if he doesn't know about my OCD, if I tell him there's a legitimate reason for my outburst he can't say I'm psychotic can he?

Anyway after a month they let me go. I stopped the meds and a while later I blew up again as I still had the same problem. Back into hospital for 7 months. When I came out of hospital this time, I convinced my parents to redo my room: new furniture, new clothes, everything. My idea was that as long as I had my safe space for me and my things I could deal with contamination outside as long as was careful not to contaminate my stuff again. IT WORKED. BETTER THAN EXPECTED. I started working again, buying stuff, enjoying myself. Over time I think it worked like some kind of ERP where little things bugged me but then I got over it until the thoughts pretty much went away and now I'd say I'm managing amazingly well with that.

My hospital admissions are my new problem however. I was really angry at the time as I felt I was being mistreated. And I still get angry. I've had two more outbursts and both times landed me in hospital. The first of these, after 2 weeks they decided I was just angry about my admission and let me go. I went home and I think I became depressed due to what they did and a week later was my last outburst. Another 5 months in hospital.

I'm gonna leave it there as there isn't much more to say anyway. I just have a few questions. Based on what I've said (and I know I could be biased):

Do you think I have/had OCD?

Can an anger outburst really be psychosis if it was for a legitimate reason? I'm not excusing my behaviour but I don't think I was psychotic.

Finally, I feel like I've now fallen into a trap. A cycle where I get angry about the past which gets me admitted and ""treated"".

t2_437k6ddm,Hi guys I just recently joined this sub as I suspect I have ocd or at least some traits of it . Lately a big fear of mine that I can’t stop thinking about is the fact that I could have high functioning autism/ nvld. Im in college right now and have not really had any friends or gone to many parties since high school started. I have  really bad social anxiety and BPD so that probably explains most of it . But my mind keeps telling me that I have a disorder which can cause social dysfunction. For the beginning of this year I started thinking I probably have aspergers/ high functioning autism cause the doctor said I could have after meeting me once cause he said I have a flat affect lol. I started getting super anxious and worried about the possibility of having it. I researched the hell out of the topic and I didn’t arrive at the conclusion of having it or not. My anxiety and fear just got more and more worse. Then I started seeing a new psychologist for my anger issues and after all the testing she said that I have BPD and generalized anxiety disorder. She then enrolled into the DBT program there so then obsessions decreased and I started putting my focus on some of the more anger and personality issues. But then all of a sudden  when I was hanging out with my cousin he said I am really awkward and made a joke that I have no friends. That sent me into a downward spiral where I started researching everything I could to explain my situation and looked through my past psych reports . One of the reports I found said that because of the difference of my performance and verbal IQ that my cognitive profile aligns with that of non verbal learning disability. it mentioned that they’re not sure but it could explain my introversion.  Then I researched non verbal learning disability and found that it can cause social issues very similar to autism such as not being able to read facial expressions. I started getting super scared and thought I won’t amount to anything in life. This is basically still going on and after confirming with three psychologists that they don’t see that I have this issue I still ruminate about it almost every day.

For the beginning of this year I started thinking I probably have aspergers/ high functioning autism cause the doctor said I could have after meeting me once cause he said I have a flat affect lol. I started getting super anxious and worried about the possibility of having it. I researched the hell out of the topic and I didn’t arrive at the conclusion of having it or not. My anxiety and fear just got more and more worse. Then I started seeing a new psychologist for my anger issues and after all the testing she said that I have BPD and generalized anxiety disorder. She then enrolled into the DBT program there so then obsessions decreased and I started putting my focus on some of the more anger and personality issues. But then all of a sudden  when I was hanging out with my cousin he said I am really awkward and made a joke that I have no friends. That sent me into a downward spiral where I started researching everything I could to explain my situation and looked through my past psych reports . One of the reports I found said that because of the difference of my performance and verbal IQ that my cognitive profile aligns with that of non verbal learning disability. it mentioned that they’re not sure but it could explain my introversion.  Then I researched non verbal learning disability and found that it can cause social issues very similar to autism such as not being able to read facial expressions. I started getting super scared and thought I won’t amount to anything in life. This is basically still going on and after confirming with three psychologists that they don’t see that I have this issue I still ruminate about it almost every day. This is really destroying my life and I don’t know how to get out of it Fear/obsession about high functioning autism or related conditions,417,8,425,0.115,0.843,0.042,-0.9664

t2_5hmry,"Hi there. In the past couple of weeks, I had a bit of an incident that has irreparably damaged a friendship brought on by my unstable mental state, which in turn seemed to be brought on or at least enhanced because I stupidly got careless with taking antidepressant medication. Naturally, I eventually was cognizant enough to realize ""oh shit, this is very much not the way i normally am"" and started taking steps to course correct and prevent this from happening again. part of it, suggested by my therapist, was seeing my psychiatrist again who i hadn't seen in a few years (I being prescribed the medicine through my physician). we had a long talk, and after i explained the whole record of events that happened the past few weeks, she told me two things: first, the fact that i stopped taking the medication wasn't the issue, it was that I started back up. Sometimes this medicine has an side effect of greatly increasing anxiety, which caught me off guard since when I initially started taking it I felt no side effects. and second was that i most likely have OCD. Particularly relationship OCD which I didn't even know was a thing. I never really even considered this a possibility because I don't have any noticeable compulsions, like excessive hand washing or something to choose a classic example. She said that's because my compulsions are pretty much all mental, based on what I described to her. Which... made sense, when she laid it out like that.

I'm not really sure why I'm making this post, honestly. Maybe a desire for solidarity? Reassurance it'll get better? This is the second friendship I've tanked in this type of way, along with in retrospect dozens of other ones that i've probably ruined because of this before they had a chance to fully grow, and now I'm doing a classic ultra pessimist outlook of assuming any serious relationship I have will ultimately end up exactly like this again, unless I somehow get a handle on this side of me. I'm just... I don't know. Scared, I suppose. I don't know anyone in real life with OCD (at least not that I know of) so I wanted to hear from others with it, and figured ""hey, there's a subreddit for people nailing bread to trees, there's gotta be one for OCD too.""",I just found out I most likely have OCD,OCD,2,cyjufr,False,"Hi there.

t2_smsr469,"I’m sorry, I know there are a lot of posts like this... I’m having a really bad night.

I’m 23 and have been with a man a little older than me for over five years. My whole life I have been attracted to older men and women but lately I’ve been struggling with what I think and hope is POCD and it’s miserable. 

I’ve had OCD ever since I can remember, with the worst one being harm OCD. It was so bad that I literally just slept all day and didn’t eat hardly anything for a few months because I was so depressed. I never had issues with POCD thoughts until recently when we’ve been around kids a lot more. We spent 4 years in another country and I never had thoughts until now we live with his family and are around like 10 kids every weekend and every time it’s miserable for me. I get such bad anxiety over it to where I’ve literally thought about killing myself but even that doesn’t make me feel better because the idea that I could even be this monster is irredeemable. I perform these compulsions like “look at this wall for 20 seconds and if I do that then I’m not a pedofile” or like “blink 10 times in a row otherwise I’ll end up doing something bad” but sometimes these thoughts feel so real. Every time I freak out I have a past memory that just enforces it.

Like sometimes I’ve seen younger preteens and have thought like “they’re going to be so handsome when they get older” etc and it’s never anything weird or sexual but it scares me. I’ve never even thought about anything like that sexually, in fact I hardly have a libido because everytime I get intimate with my husband I get these intrusive thoughts and it scares me so bad that I can’t enjoy it, so I don’t even want to do it. All my life I’ve had crushes on older men or men my age and that’s the only thing comforting me. I’m scared to tell anyone cuz like?? That’s just going to make me sound like a monster. I’ve gone to therapy before and it helped with my harm OCD but now this POCD is spiking up since I’m around children all the time. 

It sucks because I used to love being around kids and playing games with them and whatnot, I always wanted kids for the longest time but now I don’t even want to be around them because I’m so scared. I kept thinking about how one of my nephews is cute and he’s going to grow up and be handsome and I feel like a disgusting monster. Right after I got this nasty intrusive thought and I didn’t even feel excitement or anything I was just like ew wtf? And now I’m spiraling. I love kids but they annoy me with how immature they can be so the fact that I’m even worrying about this is dumb but it feels so real. 

I feel like I can’t be around my family anymore because I feel sick. I finally told me husband about it and he reassured me that I’m not and that we all have bad thoughts sometimes, these things are normal. It’s just scary. I never even want to be around kids because of this. I can’t drink either because after I do I get terrified that I must’ve gotten drunk and did something awful but I just don’t remember it. I feel disgusted with myself and it makes me want to die. But what if I’m just in denial? Ugh it scares me. I’d rather die than be some sicko that would hurt anyone.

And so instead of going out and being a normal human being, I huddled next to my video games, fighting off intrusive thoughts with the occasional loud, grunting noise or specific method of coughing.

Sometimes it actually does work. Giving yourself time away from the intrusive thoughts kind of hits the reset button, and gives you that brief clarity of mind needed to achieve mindfulness. But you have to be super involved with whatever it is that you're doing. Sometimes the thoughts just plain win, and if they're particularly mean, you strap yourself in for a panic attack.

I'm not sure why but I decided to poke the OCD bear on Friday evening. I think I was just so fed up of my current obsession that I needed another one to replace it. So ignoring my better judgement I walked onto the psychological minefield of crowdsourced horror stories. And I listened to one after another. I maintained a detached fascination until I ran into one that triggered a chain of existential dread. What a surprise, right?

Trigger warning level 1.

It's been a while since I experienced existential OCD. It was more of a feature of my teen years when I was an obsessive Christian of some sort. Thoughts of the afterlife haunted me, tortured me. A friend of mine at the time told me he was ""scared of Heaven"". It got me to thinking... is there an afterlife that isn't existentially horrifying? Eternal anything is a scary thought. I was distracted by my thoughts the entire day after he said that.

Trigger warning level 2.

Fast forward roughly ten years, for some reason I can't recall, I got caught up in the idea of free will, specifically the philosophical case that free will cannot exist. I actually grappled with that one for over a week. Eventually I became at peace with the notion. It was just a philosophical abstraction that I was obsessing over.

Trigger warning level 3.

Which brings me to present day. These stories had me thinking about the afterlife again, and against my better judgement I went online to see what people thought. That's when I ran into yet another idea that inspires existential angst, but this time it's not rooted in rational philosophy. They said the afterlife is what you believe it to be. Basically, and I'm trying to beat around the bush just writing it, the idea was that your belief somehow determines your fate. 

I had remembered thinking about the worst possible afterlife scenarios, a few years back. Basically the idea that you're stuck with the anxiety and the fear that you have on Earth while you're alive, except it's permanent. Like not even death is an escape from the fear.

Put two and two together, and you get the cognito hazard in question. I won't connect the dots explicitly but you can figure it out.

My first thought was basically, damn I wish I hadn't heard that. Then upon contemplation it occurred to me that that particular trigger wasn't the issue, it was my catastrophic thinking patterns. The trigger could have been anything. For a mind like mine, it was only a matter of time. Hey that kind of rhymes.

The obsession in question has kept me even more glued to the computer screen as attempted avoidance. Neglecting chores and fitness, instead opting to give myself space to negotiate with the thoughts. As you know, engaging with the thoughts is like challenging a pig to wrestle in the mud. Only one party enjoys it, and I guarantee it's not you.

The rationalization process I eventually went through was and still is sound. The brain is the seat of the mind, and we're dealing with here is specifically the notion that the mind can exist without the brain.","Haven't left the place in a couple days, thought I was doing so well.",OCD,1,cylqs7,False,"I gave into my obsessions this weekend.

I’ve been really really struggling with OCD intrusive thoughts that came out of nowhere, that focused on everything from my relationship with my boyfriend to my family to What If I’m A Lesbian?! (when I’m really bisexual) to a fear of developing schizophrenia, but this is the one that feels the worst. I was just sitting in the car one day and I had an intrusive thought that said “I am transgender.” and it completely terrified me and now it’s my main intrusive thought. It’s calling my whole existence into question. I have to keep repeating in my head “I am Michelle” and “I love my body” and keep touching my breasts to make sure that I’m not disgusted by them and stare at myself naked in the mirror for fear that I don’t like what I see, which of course makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I had to go to the endocrinologist for my thyroid and I was terrified the whole time because I know people get HRT there and my brain kept telling me I’d be going back there for that. I’ve been waking up with chest pain for a whole month, but my OCD has latched onto it and is trying to convince me that it’s not heartburn or a medical condition but it’s actually chest dysphoria. I’m now hyper aware of my breasts and genitals, always checking, checking, checking to make sure that I like them and identify with them. I have several lovely transgender friends and I love and respect the trans community, but I know that I’m a girl, not a trans man. The intrusive thoughts are so convincing though. I used to love my body and be proud of it, now I’m terrified and confused. I know that if it came true I’d lose my family and my boyfriend and those are my worst fears.

The OCD in general is straining my relationships with everyone I know, I’m suffering in school, and I’m severely depressed. All out of nowhere.

t2_4i4t2yit,"Decided to make an account just for this... First of all, English isn't my native language, but I hope you still understand. Second, I don't know how coherent this is, but hopefully it'll get there in the end.

I've been struggling with milder OCD-symptoms during my whole life, it's kinda always been there. About 4 years ago things got worse though and I had a really bad time with OCD related to checking: long story short, it was pure hell leaving from work or home because I was so afraid that I had left the stove or computers or any electronic devices on and I would cause a fire by that. I went back to check again or asked for reassurance from colleague or friends or family. You know how it works...

Back then I saw a psychologist couple of times and they adviced that I should write list of things I have checked (only once) and then I could check the list if I was uncertain. It kinda made things okay for a while, but didn't actually help. My OCD was always there, but this kind of reassuarance helped me surprisingly much. For a while.

I managed pretty well for couple of years, maybe because I lied to myself about the state I was in. I had obsessions and compulsions which I shrugged off as ""it's reasonable to check the stove when you leave home or it's reasonable to be sure about it by taking a picture"". I justified everything by logical thinking.

Until this summer. I have really gone over the OCD line and very far. It's the checking - it has always been that for me. And if I try to limit my checking, in comes the mental compulsions about thinking how I have most definitely checked for example the oven and all should be fine. Also there is compulsive thinking over propabilities and so on... I know I should stop compulsing like that too, but I don't know how to do it mentally.

Most of my anxieties focus on work related things, the things just change daily to whatever thing is the most catchy for me that day. Today I obsess over whether I could have heated my food on the microwave so that the microwave is left on and I don't somehow notice it - or if there's somehow a setting that could make it start later (automatic timer kind of thing) and that I accidentally used it and now I don't know about it. Just because I was the last one to use the microwave for today. I went back to check it and even opened the door because then I started also obsessing over whether I had mysteriously left some metal cutlery there - and now my obsession is telling me that this is just making *it* more plausible to happen because I checked.

Tomorrow's obsession might be ""what if I left the lights on to the toilet or left the faucet running"". And so on. And I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired of trying everyday. I'm trying so hard to not do these compulsions, and when I some days I give up and do them (like today with the microwave), I feel like I don't even deserve to get better. Everyday I remind myself that I can't be in control of everything and that shit can happen no matter how hard I try. And still I cry two hours secretly at work, because everything is so overwhelming.

I don't even know how to talk to my friends or boyfriend about my OCD, because I feel like usually it just ends up being reassurance for me and that just makes things worse. I feel so alone. I go to theraphy because of my previous depression and other anxiety issues (caused by leaving my childhood religion), but now I also worry that my therapist isn't the right kind for treating OCD (they practice  *Psychodynamic* psychotherapy) and I fear that I will not get any help.

Many individuals who have OCD also experience hoarding difficulties and we are interested in the value that people place on objects and the beliefs about what makes them important to keep. We are carrying out this research to help inform our understanding of Hoarding Disorder and improve the current treatments available. The study lasts approximate 1 hour and involves completing some questionnaires and an online card sorting task.

Some background.  I am OCD, which manifests itself with ruminating (my primary, concerning issue) but also causes me to organize and such.  My son is similar, which we thought put him on the spectrum, but with my own OCD diagnosis last year I suspect that's an issue for him, too (of course, after diagnosis I see OCD everywhere!).

He has always dressed in khaki and polo shirts or t-shirts.  Recently, he shared that he has never felt at home with his friends; it is all on the surface.  He's happy, but cut off a bit.  A few years ago he decided he was bisexual, now pansexual, because he could not put his attractions in a single, traditional box.  He has found a group on reddit and is exploring things.

His reason for exploring women's clothing is that he does not feel he fits in the box of masculinity.  At the same time, he says he has no interest in limiting himself in the box of femininity.  In short, he wants to be him and find out what that means.  He knows he's not trans.

I am scared to death for him.  This is on two fronts.  First, it's a hard road.  I don't want him to get the shit kicked out of him or face any of the negative crap society doles out.  As his father, I want to protect him.  Second, I have never been comfortable with trans anything.  I don't like women in make-up or jewelry so anyone making that leap baffles me and I can't get past it.  That's my problem, not my son's.  Except, I want to support him in being happy and finding himself but I am finding it hard to look past the surface.  I think I'm having a harder time with this than he is.

This is all new--two weeks for me.  He has said he does not want to draw attention to himself, and is very rational in his plans.  I appreciate this.  Unfortunately, he doesn't know what he doesn't know and (as a teacher) see the thousand ways people see what you don't expect them to see or pick up on.  I've talked about the spectrum of who he is, the spectrum of neutral to male behaviors our society accepts, and the Venn diagram of the safe areas (yes, we organize our family discussions with diagrams).  But I can't protect him and he needs to be happy.

A few years ago he decided he was bisexual, now pansexual, because he could not put his attractions in a single, traditional box.  He has found a group on reddit and is exploring things.

His reason for exploring women's clothing is that he does not feel he fits in the box of masculinity.  At the same time, he says he has no interest in limiting himself in the box of femininity.  In short, he wants to be him and find out what that means.  He knows he's not trans.

I am scared to death for him.  This is on two fronts.  First, it's a hard road.  I don't want him to get the shit kicked out of him or face any of the negative crap society doles out.  As his father, I want to protect him.  Second, I have never been comfortable with trans anything.  I don't like women in make-up or jewelry so anyone making that leap baffles me and I can't get past it.  That's my problem, not my son's.  Except, I want to support him in being happy and finding himself but I am finding it hard to look past the surface.  I think I'm having a harder time with this than he is.

This is all new--two weeks for me.  He has said he does not want to draw attention to himself, and is very rational in his plans.  I appreciate this.  Unfortunately, he doesn't know what he doesn't know and (as a teacher) see the thousand ways people see what you don't expect them to see or pick up on.  I've talked about the spectrum of who he is, the spectrum of neutral to male behaviors our society accepts, and the Venn diagram of the safe areas (yes, we organize our family discussions with diagrams).  But I can't protect him and he needs to be happy.  

It's pushing all of my buttons because I can't control any of it. Struggling With Son Experimenting With Women's Clothes",448,7,455,0.104,0.782,0.115,0.9236

I’ve been experiencing severe rumination for the past few days, brought on by drinking. There were several events I attended on Saturday, and it was a kind of continuous drinking marathon.

When I woke up on Sunday, I had a severe panic attack replaying all the events and convincing myself something awful had happened or I said something stupid to someone along the way. I already asked my partner and friends who were with me the whole day about the day, and was assured it was a fun day for everyone and I didn’t do anything. However, as we know with reassurance seeking, it only fed my thoughts.

I’m just trying to find a way to convince my mom to get her tubes tied, I know it sounds a bit extreme but this is the necessary thing that will end the mental disease which’s been fuckin up my mind for 4 damn years. My mother has no idea about this obsession of mine. But I really need to get this done, I want a life. Please help, how do I convince her to get her tubes tied? Need you guys’ help, this shit sucks!!",317,7,324,0.142,0.697,0.161,0.7445
t2_4fjkcrq1,"I think I’ve always had a form of OCD that attaches to anything I get to really like. EG for a while I found I really liked wearing nice clothes - then OCD would attach to that making me compulsively obsess were they the correct colour/fit/pattern - you name it! It drove me mad, it was horrible. 

I had to abandon dressing well &amp; instead dress for function. That change was such a massive relief! I don’t care about how I look much at all anymore. 

One thing I really love is exercise and martial arts, just dynamic movement. It makes me completely present, nothing else exists. 

So obsession latches on to that with constant worry I’ll tear a muscle and something I love will be taken away from me. And the worry that will be too emotionally difficult to deal with. 

Like a lot of my OCD, there used to be a logic to this worry - I DO have an old disc injury in my back, and I do have a slightly disabled right leg (from an accident in 2002). 

Both those injuries threw me into 2 years of isolation which was horrible. I associate exercise injuries with nasty depression. 

But that logic is way back in the past, I have great support in my life, no chance of being isolated and alone. So now the worry is ‘plausible but untrue’ and it’s simply OCD. 

I haven’t asked for help with this - not since Pure O has been recognised. 

I just have a diagnosis of Asperger’s, but these short circuit thoughts have always plagued me. 

Have any of you found ERP to be effective for this kind of hypochondria? I already take venlafaxine and mirtazapine and these have really helped lessen the rumination, but it’s still a problem. 

I wonder if a moderately physical job is a good answer - exposure therapy 40 hours a week. That the solution is to work through all kinds of strains and sprains until I no longer fear them.

t2_2qr5m1s5,"Hi everyone. I posted here early this summer because I was worried I was exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behaviour relating to infection and contamination. I hadn't had to deal with anything like OCD before this summer, and it seemed to be ""triggered"" (for lack of a better term) by a very ill-timed virus I got towards the end of my university exam season. Since then, I have been diagnosed with OCD and have been attending therapy sessions and taking SSRIs. 

On balance, I think the treatment has been helping. I recently went on holiday and I made a great deal of progress when I was there, doing things I couldn't have done before I started taking medication/going to therapy. However, since I got back on saturday I've taken a few steps back. I developed cold-like symptoms after the flight home, and since picking up illnesses is the main source of my anxiety, I think I've handled it pretty well. I did, however, resume certain habits I had managed to kick while I was on holiday. 

Then, when my brother got home from work today, he had cold symptoms. It could be the same virus I had but I'm not sure if I even got a fully-blown cold, and even if I did I was extremely careful to wash my hands, not cough into the open air, etc. So, I'm worried he doesn't have the virus I had, but rather picked up something else from work. I basically fled the house and have now been sitting in the cold for an hour because I can't face the prospect of facing yet another illness.

I know it seems silly to worry about little bugs so much, but I cannot stand being out of control, and when I'm ill I have basically zero control over what's going on with my body. It makes me very distressed and I don't think I could cope with another virus after just enduring cold-like symptoms. 

How do I cope with this? Does anyone have any tips on how I can calm myself down enough to go back to the house? I'm considering getting the train back to uni right now but I wouldn't be able to say bye to my family and my meds are at home. I'm so humiliated. I can't believe this is my life now.

I have a lot going on right now.  Trying to do a lot around my apartment to get ready to move, basically I had a pot of water on the stove.  It was a large pot, I am also in the living room doing laundry and packing some stuff.

It wasn't boiled away much at all, but I just have really bad obsessive thoughts about my mistakes especially when they waste resources or cost money.

I saw one post that this guy was asking how much it cost him when he left on his stove for 12 hours, and an answer was ""maybe 1.21 and thats assuming you have a high running stove"".

When I was a young kid, my OCD would make me think of disgusting things while I would eat lunch or dinner and it would always give me a gag sensation. I , to this day, avoid certain types of food due to those intrusive thoughts. It made my life very difficult at some point because eating becomes rough. My life is still hard today because I am always afraid my brain will suddenly make me think negatively about what I'm eating. Wish me luck in this struggle guys.

t2_3w203u32,"I'm 31 and I've been struggling with OCD and Depression for years. Haven't had great psychs or therapists up to this point.

My OCD has always focused on religious fears (like Hell and similar things). 

I've been taking the generic of Paxil for a few years now. It doesn't really *help* but it kinda keeps me going and I can at least get through the day. Every so often I try a different medication but it doesn't make much of a difference within the 2 month period I give it, so I go back to the Paxil.

Late last year, I noticed I felt like I was having trouble understanding lines in a video game or TV show I was watching. I'd have to go over it again later after I was done, to make sure I understood it. 

As time went on, that would still happen from time to time. Usually it would be because the line of dialogue is actually somewhat confusing, but occasionally that wasn't the case.

In early September, I tried another medication, and after about a week something unexpected happened. My OCD, my regular OCD, spiked worse than I've ever seen. 

The whole nine yards - I'd empty my clothes from the dryer but I would get stuck there because I wasn't totally sure the dryer was empty. I'd send an email to someone but it wouldn't ""click"" in my brain that I'd sent the email. 

And the worst thing has been reading. It's gotten to a point where I will read a certain bit of information and my brain will insist I don't understand it, that I am not processing it at all. If I go ahead and pick it apart later, it turns out I did understand it (nine times out of ten, every so often people just phrase things weirdly). 

But I reached a point where I was honestly scared to do anything. Scared to run into this wall again, regardless of what the activity was. I'd try to put mail into a mailbox but it wouldn't ""click"" in my brain that I successfully put the mail into the slot. I'd drive home worrying that I'd somehow dropped the mail out of the box and that it was lying on the ground.

I decided I wanted to go back on my old medication. My psychiatrist is generally unreachable (I'm in the process of trying to find a new one) so I switched myself back to the Paxil.

It's been a little over a week and I'm still having this trouble. I'm genuinely scared because I feel like I've totally lost it. It shouldn't take this much mental focus and energy to understand things that I read. It never really did before, either.

To anyone who's dealt with this kind of thing, what helps? All I know is to do my best not to feed into the OCD, but it's extremely difficult in that moment that I'm putting the mail in the mailbox. It's insanely hard to continue reading something after reading a section that my brain insists I didn't fully understand.

Don't let it get to you!!!""  But this never gives me any kind of lasting comfort.

It made me feel gross. Hiding made me feel safe.  Then I realized that by hiding, I was hiding my light, I was hiding ME. Nowadays, I think it has gotten better.

t2_1kpdas1f,"   Looking back, symptoms of what I now know to be OCD plagued me from a young age (I’m sure a lot of you can relate). But I want to talk about this particular form of it especially. I’m not sure where it came from, but I started having trouble opening new toys and gifts. My go to toy of my childhood was always LEGO, and receiving a new set started to become more and more ceremonious. If it was a set I was looking forward to for a long time or one that I *really* wanted, it would take a lot of willpower and caution to open. I didn’t shred off the wrapping paper like I used to. This is normal *to an extent*, I mean that’s why we have unboxing videos after all. If it’s something you really wanted, you gotta do it right... right? Well, it got a little out of hand as the years went by. I distinctly remember having to lay out paper towel on the carpet to build a particular LEGO set on top of it, in fear of contamination (not necessarily germs and bacteria, but the idea of something new touching something old). Even after I built it, I’d play with it alone and not let it touch “older” LEGOs until that feeling wore off and I went back to being a normal kid. For clarification, it’s only with things that I actually want. Opening a bag of chips or twisting open a bottle doesn’t bat an eyelash for me (thanks teenage appetite).

   Fast forward a few years later, I’m 16 now and the issue has snowballed. The excitement and joy of opening a product that I wanted became replaced with anxiety and dread. Since I’m a bit older, I’ve obviously received more... precious (for lack of better words) things like gaming systems and phones. Expensive and far less frequent purchases like these take even more willpower to push myself to open. It’s not so much contamination anymore as it is just wanting to “do it right”. I have to be feeling good, wash my hands, be at home, and be given time to do it slowly and carefully. Unfortunately the crazy world we live in rarely gives us these luxuries, and it perpetuates the anxiety more and more. The stress of being a teenager with depression, attending an overpopulated high school, going through life changes, and receiving more responsibilities calls for the literal alignment of the stars and planets to be able to do things the way I (or should I say my OCD) truly wants. I mean why would you want to open a new product when you feel like crap? That’s like eating gourmet food off of a plate that just had dog poop on it.

   It’s gotten to the point where I will leave things I was *dying* to have on a shelf for months on end because I didn’t feel ready to open them. The bags and boxes just become decorations that I avoid getting around to. How ironic is that? Over the years my family has gotten more and more frustrated with this as well as the many other forms of my OCD, and I’m sure everyone here knows how crazy it sounds to put your obsessions and compulsions into words. As if I’m not angry with myself over these things enough, my family pressures me to open and use new products no matter what I say. It escalated pretty quickly these days, and they think they’re helping me once I finally start using it. *Of course* I’m going to be okay with using it AFTER the ceremony of opening it, it’s not like I don’t want it, but that just feeds the illusion of them “helping” me. They’ve tried scaring me into it by threatening to return the product, but it just makes things so much worse.

   This is just one aspect of the disorder that has become debilitating for me. Every once in a while I’ll feel a little nugget of happiness and excitement when I remember that *that thing* I’ve been wanting is just sitting there waiting to be open, but it gets drowned out almost instantly by stress.

   However, it’s not all bad news. Over the summer I’ve managed to find the best therapist I’ve ever been to, and I’ve finally started making a dent in my issues. As of right now I can only go once a week; and since there’s so much to fix it’s going to be a long time until I can get some of these things under control. I’ve also been trying new medications with my psychiatrist, but we all know how long that can take to start working. I tell my family that I need to work on this with my therapist first, but they insist that their “do or die” method is best. Just them telling me that I need to open something soon is enough to trigger me these days, or potentially have a panic attack, making it even less likely for me to open my things.

   Does anyone have any advice on this? Whether it’s a mindset to have while opening things, a way to explain this better to my family, something to bring up with the therapist, your experience/journey, a slap in the face to just bite the bullet, etc.? Even words of comfort help, especially since we’re all in the same boat.

   Phew, that went on much longer than I thought it would. Thank you so much for reading this if you did. I just need some extra support right now.

i told myself that if i changed my name again (and went thru the process of making the whole new gmail, etc) again in the next 21 days that i would sell my most prized possession for $1 (my lava lamp lol, it genuinely makes me stupidly happy) and im scared i wont make it D: i dont know what to dooo anymore and it's just so frustrating to try to figure it all out Name ocd? i'm struggling",359,4,363,0.165,0.726,0.109,-0.9807

I posted earlier about asking how long it would take to feel the increase in my sertraline, and what do you know! I feel it today. I’d been on 50mg for 8 years, which I truly believe did nothing. I got increasingly anxious and ocd sympotmatic over the summer, and we increased to 75mg. Again, this didn’t work, so my doctor had me go to 125mg for a week, then 200mg.

t2_15db7sre,"Does this sound OCD related? I REALLY would like a second opinion

I’m not entirely sure if I am able to ask this, so hopefully it won’t be removed by mods... sorry if this is a little long. There is a tl;dr at the bottom.

Within the last year I’ve been diagnosed with both depression and generalized anxiety disorder. From what I can tell I’ve been dealing with this stuff since I was in middle school, and from then it’s been a series of highs and lows. However, the last 2 years have been really rough, and I’ve started seeking professional help. 

OCD was actually brought to my attention by a friend of mine (who is diagnosed with OCD). I remember I was talking about my feelings of unnecessary guilt and the need to incessantly apologize and “fix” it. I would feel the need to apologize or do something in order to not ruin my good relationship with the person. He compared this thought cycle to the OCD circle and since then I’ve been extremely concerned with whether or not I have OCD or not. It’s like a feeling of genuineness and like I’m faking it for the sake of being different or quirky. I’ve done as many online tests as I can think of. When the answer say “yes, you may have OCD” I feel like I’ve over exaggerated my answers or that the conclusion couldn’t possibly be true. However, when it says “no,” I’m not satisfied and try to find another test. I’ve recently started doing this again after someone told me that I was being obsessive, and I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I feel so guilty because of this though, I feel as though I am a bad person for making things up and lying about my mental state, so bad that I’m afraid to mention it to my doctor. 

Additionally, I would say I am WAY to obsessed with my relationship. I do have a lot of feelings for this friend of mine, and nearly every interaction I have with them is extremely anxiety inducing. I always fear as if I will mess up and profusely apologize for things, even if nothing is wrong, or ask if everything is ok, for the sake of feeling as if the relationship isn’t ruined. I feel as though if I say it enough times, it will be fixed. If I ask him enough times and out enough effort into making sure everything is ok, then everything will be ok. I keep stressing over these small flaws in our relationship. Furthermore, though we are not currently dating, we had been previously, and I always make up scenarios in my head to see if we are still compatible, if I still love him, if I’m still aroused by him, if he still loves me, if we would work out in a long term relationship, if we could potentially live together, be married etc. I go down these thought paths and try and plan everything out and make sure that it is still possible. What are your thoughts, is this normal behavior? Am I just in love or am I obsessed with him? Also, I feel as if I were to start seeing someone new I wouldn’t have feelings and would definitely stress out if the relationship wasn’t as “good” or if I could have an ideal perfect relationship. 

Also, I should mention that around the time I was 10-12 I remember having a lot of thoughts surrounding harm. I remember seeing myself stabbing people with knives, scooping eyes out with spoons, a so on... I don’t particularly remember if it caused any significant anxiety or stress though, so I’m not sure if this is OCD either. But it did lead me to think for a decent amount of time that I was a closeted sociopath, which led me again to take a load of online psychopathy and EQ tests to make sure I was functioning normally. Since then, I do feel sometimes that I can have behaviors linked with being a sociopath or a narcissist so I try not to talk about my achievements too much and have questioned others if they think I’m bad or able to work normally, like as a person. Lately though, I feel as though these thoughts are coming back, but every time I think about them I can’t be sure if it’s on purpose to make myself “fit in” with an OCD diagnosis or if they are involuntary thoughts. But what I’ve been doing is repeating phrases to myself to make sure that they don’t happen in real life. For example, this morning I had a feeling that I would be decapitated, so I made sure to cover the back of my neck and say to “please don’t cut off my head” until I felt that it was ok again. That’s just one example, I wouldn’t say I spend multiple hours doing this though, so I’m not sure if it’s indicative of OCD or not. This goes again with, I’m not sure if what I’m thinking is self-induced to purposely fit a diagnosis or if I actually may have OCD, and it’s really driving me crazy. 

Lastly, I’ve had a skin picking habit since before I can remember, and often find that I get lost in doing this and it can go on for quite a long time. I’m not sure if this is an anxiety response or a compulsive thing.

Thanks for reading this if you got this far! I really would like to know if this sounds consistent with OCD or if it just seems like im being performative or fishing for a diagnosis. Whichever answer I get, i probably won’t be satisfied with it and will definitely doubt it and try and make sure if it is correct or not... it feels as if I can never get a rest from this thought... I go completely back and forth, I feel as though I may have OCD, but then the next hour I feel as if it’s all made up in my head and I start to question if I’m telling the truth to myself or not.

a part of me, when heard that suggestion felt relieved but I told myself and maybe God that ocd is going trap me and what will happen I guess are thoughts without my will and not valid. I even told Him in the past there will be times that some thoughts without my will will try to trap me or affect me or relieve me. no matter how much attention I pay to them. they are not valid.

after ocd made the suggestion, I told myselrf or maybe God that ocd will do its usual stuff and set me atrap. I think I am not sure but I thnk deep inside me I was telling God that these thoughts that are going to follow are not my thoughts.

in the next second, I don't remember why but there is a chance a part of me maybe accidentally, allowed the thoughts about promise without my will to happen in my head.

in the next second, a part of me was like ""oh no thanks to the thoughts without my will I should not do the compulsion. ayay.''

and in the next seconds, I was like ""wait! what happened? no! it is all thoughts without my will and mistake. I do not want them""

ocd: too late! you maybe a part of yours allowed the thoughts without your will to pop up in your head just to use them as an excuse not to do the compulsion in order to relieve yourself from the worries. you should have ignored the thoughts without your will but you pretendted that they happened without your will. you paid attention to them. maybe you forced the thoughts without your will to happen for a second. maybe that made the thoughts valid.

I have told God in the past, that I may somehow be careless for some seconds and may act without my will accidentally or a part of me accidentally act like it is ocd, but the reason this happens is because I know they are thoughts without my will no matter how much I may pretend if I pretend.

I'm worrying about thoughtforms. I saw a woman online who said she has literally seen thoughtforms form in the air in front of her.


I messaged her and she said I have ocd and she replied with this 


Don't be afraid of thought forms. We all make them constantly. If you see one you do not like, just visualize what you do want and replace the old with the new. Otherwise, let them come and go on their own.

I'm worried I will have to constantly imagine destroying this thought forms as a new compulsion. 

I have a really weird metaphysical obession where I fear I will enter the perspective/mind of someone bad. As mad as it sounds, I saw a video by teal swan who provided a visualization technique on how to do this. And in magick I've seen several visualizations that seem to support this idea. Such as assumption 


""You just visualize your target person (with your eyes open) in front of you, a real living image of the person you wish to match.

It might take you a few minutes to really get into the feeling of them being there. And when you feel that image of them is as real as you can make it, you just physically step into it.

(Of course, to someone watching, you are stepping into nothing but an empty space on the floor)

As you step into that image, now feel yourself as that person. The trick is not to feel yourself as you within them but instead to feel you as that person...there should be no feeling of separation.

If you get it right, you will almost feel like you are not yourself anymore.

And in this state of vibrational attunement, thoughts will pass easily between the two of you, and things that you think you want to do (as them), they will also be thinking they want to do...if they are in a situation where they can be receptive to their thoughts in that moment.

Me &amp; my girlfriend (well, fiancée now) are very naturally vibrationally in-tune so it's quite easy for me (using this method) to pick up her thoughts, or make her look towards me when she is off in the distance across a crowded room, or get in touch when she is uncontactable by normal means.

How you use a method like this is really up to you and your imagination.

It's also a great way to get rapport with someone you wish to like you, for example, at a job interview. You just step into the person interviewing you while they are interviewing you and you'll both seem to be on the same wavelength...because literally you will be :)

Of course, you don't literally get up out of your seat and step into an image of them while they are talking to you, you just do it in your mind...shifting your body slightly in your seat as you merge with them helps a lot to give you the feeling of stepping into them.

This is a very old occult technique that is spoken about in hushed tones in certain mystical circles because there is a fear that it can be used for the manipulation of others. Indeed, these days you'll get many mind-control and romantic/casual datingauthors selling you this basic method for the sole purpose of manipulating others.

You can waste a lot of time with techniques like this making other people do little things for you here and there. Myself, I spent years playing around with this sort of stuff before I eventually got bored of it.

You see, in the end, it's really quite hard work ""manipulating"" others. :)

I put ""manipulating"" in quotes in that last sentence because ultimately you cannot make anyone do anything they definitely don't want to do. Try it if you don't believe me - nothing bad will happen, you'll just end up disappointed. There's a lot of misguided fear-mongering that goes on with people who warn about using techniques like this...and almost invariably those people have never tried these methods and have no real idea how they work anyway...much like in the world of manifesting techniques, in fact :)

What you'll eventually find about using methods like this to ""manipulate"" others is that it's a hard, painful and ultimately un-satisfying way to live your life.

If you think about it, constantly trying to control the behavior of others makes you a slave to who they are, their whims, their ever-changing moods and fancies. A prison guard is just as much a prisoner as the prisoner s/he is guarding :)""

t2_433xt27i,"As i recall, I've pretty much had intrusive thoughts at some point in my life but was never bothered by them. Starting last December i unexpectedly had a horrible thought which led me to believe that i was a bad person who wanted to do horrible things. This was followed by great shame and guilt which made me question myself regularly: Am i a bad person?, what does this thought says about me? Am i a psychopath? What would make a person think this? The thoughts would make me become obsessed for days or weeks at a time as i would try desperately to make it stop. I would spend hours and hours reading about intrusive thoughts and ocd online, then i started to tell my bf about the thoughts to which he said that it was normal and everyone has them. However this only made me feel relieved temporarily. As soon as i got over one bad thought i was hit with something worst. My intrusive thoughts included *what ifs* such as: what if i were a pedophile?, what if i became attracted to my family members, what if i had an urge that i couldn't control? And so much more dark horrible thoughts towards the people who i loved and cared about the most. It became worst when i started to have them during dinner, intimate moments basically anything that made me happy. My intrusive thoughts focused mostly on pedophilia, sexual and harm ocd. At one point my ocd was letting me believe that i was getting turned on by the intrusive thoughts which and me constantly check myself. Never at any time did i enjoy any of those thoughts yet i'd have what you call gronial movements. 
Tips on how i got over my ocd and intrusive thoughts:
1) Do not engage with the thought. You have an odd horrible thought- instead of questioning why you're having them just say what was that and continue doing whatever you were doing.
2) Accept the thought. This doesn't mean you have to like the thought or be okay with the bad thing. Just accept that you had a bad thought and move on.
3) know that you're not alone, we're human and our brain is constantly looking for problems to solve, distract yourself.
4) Understand that these thoughts are just your brain sending signal to you to make sure you're being careful for eg. you're walking down a stair with a knife and have an image or thought about falling and stabbing yourself. The reason for that thought is to let you be aware of what could possibly happen if you're not careful. So to avoid that you would either walk slower or put the knife away.
5) know that the reason you're constantly worried or feel guilty and shame of the thought is because you're afraid if you want to do it... someone who actually want to do any of those things won't feel ashamed or even think about it. 
6) know that you're not a bad person based on your thoughts, your actions and contributes toward society is what really matters.
7) understand that gronial movements because of intrusive thoughts is normal, our brain only needs to hear or think about sex and it would start sending signals to the rest of your body. It doesn't mean that you want do any of thise things or what them to be done to you. 
8)Make jokes about it. 
9) know that when we die we wouldn't be remember for our thoughts ir whatever we have going in in our head. People will remember use for who we really are. The person they can see and know.
10) The most important one for me is EXPOSURE.. for an entire year i stayed away from my nieces because i was afraid i would hurt them.. just a few days after i started being around them ny intrusive thoughts were just thoughts, they didnt matter to me, i realized i wasn't the person in my thoughts, i stopped living in my head and started living in the present.

But now that I know the truth, how am I supposed to move on? After years of calling out assault, I am just as bad. Assault is one of the worst things a man can do.

I considered making a public confession. Some call it ""cancelling."" Shaming and permanently avoiding people who do bad things, usually assault. I agree that is a good thing. If I lose my job, friends, and family, well then, don't I deserve that? If everyone I know abandons me, it's only because I earned it.

After years of being the ""good guy"" even browsing /r/circlebroke and /r/circlebroke2 during the time this happened.... I am the piece of shit I fought against. 

I've also been less than respectful with consent in a relationship with my girlfriend. She says she never felt assaulted, but the fact I had to question that makes me worry. 

At one point, I asked her if she wanted to have sex. She said no. I asked her if she wanted to get nude. She said yes, so I asked her for sex again to which she agreed.

I also once continued getting sexual with her even though I knew I was losing interest in the relationship. Some call this rape by deception.

My therapist tried to explain to me none of it was assault this morning. He remindes me of the time I once had a girlfriend who I wasn't into as much as she was to me. I told him that would be rape by deception and he disagrees. But he's literally describing rape by deception.

He's looked up assault laws to PROVE I didn't assault those women I hugged. He had a hard time, but refuses to just accept it. He copped out by saying **if I'm guilty of assault or rape, 99% of all people are**.

I almost wish I could go back to before I discovered all feminism. Not that it would be a good thing, but I admit I miss the bliss of ignorance and being able to trust my therapist.

I'm at a loss. The only thing preventing suicide is the fact I have friends and family.","IT WAS ASSAULT. My story was posted on Reddit. This may not be the place, but I'm extremely desperate.

t2_4vscdr3j,"So I have been diagnosed with OCD for about three years now, but given the way I presented throughout my childhood I've likely struggled with it for longer than we realize. I tried to get treatment for it a little over a year ago, but the psychiatrist I was seeing was not on the same page as me and I ended up trialling many meds that seemed to make my mental health significantly worse. Since weening of the meds and leaving that Psychiatrists practice, I have been completely without psych care and have been just trying to manage on my own. I believe I've been doing significantly better than I was when I was on all kinds of medications, but I am still struggling with all kinds of obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts. For the most part, I manage well and am fairly good at functioning around the OCD, but recently I started having intrusive thoughts that are completely crippling me, and I know I need help before I spiral into a disassociative episode from the constant high levels of anxiety.  

Every night, I get into bed and lay there thinking about death and eternity. I know death is a common theme seen in OCD, but it's not so much the concept of death that I ruminate on, it's the concept of eternity. The fact that time is eternal. It literally goes on forever and there is literally no end to time ever. Time has always and will always exist. There has been a full eternity before any of us existed and after everything and everyone present on earth currently ceases to exist, time and eternity will still exist. It literally N E V E R ends and my brain cannot grasp the concept that things go on forever, that time goes on forever. When you die, you are gone forever. And forever never ends. So you are literally rotting in the ground for eternity and that's so fucked and I can't grasp it like what the hell is the point??!! Even the idea of dying and going to heaven terrifies me because the concept of being there forever and time never ending ever literally EVER is horrible and I can't grasp it and I am honest to god trying not to spiral into a panic attack about it just from typing this out. My brain cannot grasp and accept the fact that eternity never ends. Time goes on forever and time never stops. Literally ever. Not even billions and billions of years. Time is eternal. I am not scared to die, and sometimes it brings me comfort to think that when I die I'm just dead and won't even be alive to stress about these things but then I just cannot stop feeling sick about the fact that I am then just rotting in the ground for eternity which will literally never end. I just run myself in circles trying to grasp it all and accept it but the idea of eternity and time being eternal and literally never stopping ever is the most jarring thing and I don't know how to let this one go. I can't see any point in life anymore because I'm like wow I'm just gonna die and rot for eternity anyways. The idea of reincarnation I guess is the least scary for me because then you have the idea of restarting a life and then ending that life and nothing actually lasting forever, but the more I think about it reincarnation scares me too for other reasons and I can't even really force myself to believe it anyways. 

I would go through phases where I'd have these thoughts as a child. Like, these exact thoughts about eternity. I have been upset by the concept and trying to grasp eternity since I was about 8 years old and realized that one day I would die and never come back, ever. Eventually I got through the phases and would accept life for what it is, but as soon as I remember the concept and it enters my brain even slightly I cannot help but falling down the rabbit whole and spiralling about this shit even though there's no answers and eternity is just terrifying.  Its causing me so much stress that as soon as these thoughts enter my mind, if I'm not sitting on laying down I will literally feel the blood rush through me and almost faint from fear. I will be so upset that I'll be pale in the face and need to run to the bathroom to be sick or feel like I'm going to crap my pants. The fear is crippling and now it's to the point where if my brain isn't fully , constantly distracted, I get very scared and upset by this and can't stop thinking about it. I try to sleep with the TV on so that my brain can focus on that but I can't focus on anything but these thoughts and I lose so much sleep laying there sick about this. 

Like I said, I know death is a common theme for OCD, so does this fit into this category? Or is this more existential? Do any other OCD sufferers get these specific thoughts about eternity? How in the hell do I manage it? Its so bad I am genuinely terrified I'll send myself into a breakdown and end up with psychosis or something because my brain literally cannot cope.

So I have been diagnosed with OCD for about three years now, but given the way I presented throughout my childhood I've likely struggled with it for longer than we realize. I tried to get treatment for it a little over a year ago, but the psychiatrist I was seeing was not on the same page as me and I ended up trialling many meds that seemed to make my mental health significantly worse. Since weening of the meds and leaving that Psychiatrists practice, I have been completely without psych care and have been just trying to manage on my own. I believe I've been doing significantly better than I was when I was on all kinds of medications, but I am still struggling with all kinds of obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts. For the most part, I manage well and am fairly good at functioning around the OCD, but recently I started having intrusive thoughts that are completely crippling me, and I know I need help before I spiral into a disassociative episode from the constant high levels of anxiety.  

Every night, I get into bed and lay there thinking about death and eternity. I know death is a common theme seen in OCD, but it's not so much the concept of death that I ruminate on, it's the concept of eternity. The fact that time is eternal. It literally goes on forever and there is literally no end to time ever. Time has always and will always exist. There has been a full eternity before any of us existed and after everything and everyone present on earth currently ceases to exist, time and eternity will still exist. It literally N E V E R ends and my brain cannot grasp the concept that things go on forever, that time goes on forever. When you die, you are gone forever. And forever never ends. So you are literally rotting in the ground for eternity and that's so fucked and I can't grasp it like what the hell is the point??!! Even the idea of dying and going to heaven terrifies me because the concept of being there forever and time never ending ever literally EVER is horrible and I can't grasp it and I am honest to god trying not to spiral into a panic attack about it just from typing this out. My brain cannot grasp and accept the fact that eternity never ends. Time goes on forever and time never stops. Literally ever. Not even billions and billions of years. Time is eternal. I am not scared to die, and sometimes it brings me comfort to think that when I die I'm just dead and won't even be alive to stress about these things but then I just cannot stop feeling sick about the fact that I am then just rotting in the ground for eternity which will literally never end. I just run myself in circles trying to grasp it all and accept it but the idea of eternity and time being eternal and literally never stopping ever is the most jarring thing and I don't know how to let this one go. I can't see any point in life anymore because I'm like wow I'm just gonna die and rot for eternity anyways. The idea of reincarnation I guess is the least scary for me because then you have the idea of restarting a life and then ending that life and nothing actually lasting forever, but the more I think about it reincarnation scares me too for other reasons and I can't even really force myself to believe it anyways. 

I would go through phases where I'd have these thoughts as a child. Like, these exact thoughts about eternity. I have been upset by the concept and trying to grasp eternity since I was about 8 years old and realized that one day I would die and never come back, ever. Eventually I got through the phases and would accept life for what it is, but as soon as I remember the concept and it enters my brain even slightly I cannot help but falling down the rabbit whole and spiralling about this shit even though there's no answers and eternity is just terrifying.  Its causing me so much stress that as soon as these thoughts enter my mind, if I'm not sitting on laying down I will literally feel the blood rush through me and almost faint from fear. I will be so upset that I'll be pale in the face and need to run to the bathroom to be sick or feel like I'm going to crap my pants. The fear is crippling and now it's to the point where if my brain isn't fully , constantly distracted, I get very scared and upset by this and can't stop thinking about it. I try to sleep with the TV on so that my brain can focus on that but I can't focus on anything but these thoughts and I lose so much sleep laying there sick about this. 

Like I said, I know death is a common theme for OCD, so does this fit into this category? Or is this more existential? Do any other OCD sufferers get these specific thoughts about eternity? How in the hell do I manage it? Its so bad I am genuinely terrified I'll send myself into a breakdown and end up with psychosis or something because my brain literally cannot cope. I'm just looking for any words that can make me feel a bit better about this stuff because I'm not joking when I say it's crippling. Please someone help",How to recover from/cope with existential OCD?,OCD,6,dqa1j4,False,"So I made a longer post in here earlier and it was actually downvoted.

t2_10xjkr,"Hi 

Please let me know if this is not the right sub for this. I am looking for a compassionate way to respond to my mom who has OCD. I'm 28\[F\] and she's 68. 

She compulsively asks questions and jumps from topic to topic. She asks the same questions and doesn't allow room for the other person to speak. She tends to just think of something new if a few seconds of silence follow an answer. It seems reasonable that this is a manifestation of her OCD.

I've said ""can I please have a break from the questions"" and she seems to feel embarrassed but stops for a bit and it seems like she understands intellectually. However, she just ramps right up after maybe 20 minutes or so. 

All of her questions grate on me- I literally feel my throat tighten, stomach turn in knots. I hate these physical effects and the anxiety I feel around her. 

I went to therapy and did a session with her. It went surprisingly well- in it we set boundaries of behaviors I specifically didn't want her to do, but they were more about like ""please do not pressure me to come home for Christmas."" She actually has been good about avoiding these behaviors which helped. However, I am struggling to think of a hard boundary she can follow for conversations with me.

It's also hard on my fiance, who does not feel as comfortable saying ""can I have a break from questions."" I also feel like if I said ""can you give fiance a break"" she might argue back.. it would seem like overstepping (but maybe not).

I have thought of light-heartedly saying ""alright mom let me teach you how I like to have conversations. You ask a question and then wait for the other person to ask a question before you ask one."" It seems heavy-handed and a bit disrespectful, but maybe not.

t2_4x10bepi,"This past weekend I fetched my electric trimmer in order to shave my beard. When I took the trimmer out of its case I decided it was necessary to wash it with water before using it. I made this decision because I had used the trimmer multiple times since I purchased it and I had yet to clean it in any capacity. I recently had a bacterial infection on my skin and I decided that this was a responsible act in order to prevent another one. 

I turned on the faucet and began washing the electric trimmer.  I became anxious before and while holding the object under the faucet because, a few years back, my cousin was unexpectedly electrocuted and he passed away. He was a plumber and was exposed to a strong electrical current when working. I felt personal responsibility make sure that I dried the appliance completely before plugging it in order to completely minimize the chance of electrocution. 

Both subconsciously and consciously I began thinking that I need to be careful because I cannot expose another tragedy to my family. If I plug the trimmer in when it is wet I am increasing the possibility of electrocution and am risking severe injury or death. Such an act would  be careless and negligent and I would not taking the necessary responsibility for my life

These thoughts persisted as I began drying the appliance with a towel. I was compulsively drying the trimmer to try and remove all water. I felt obligated to dry every inch of the appliance. I felt urges to plug it in while I was drying it and I could not follow through with them because of the possibility that those urges were driven by a desire for self-harm or a desire to destroy my family by potentially getting electrocuted. In general I could not be sure that the urges were not completely devoid of malicious intent. 

As I continued drying the appliance and began considering the fact that I may be ready to move on with plugging it in I eventually felt some water on the base of the trimmer. At this point, instead of continuing to dry the trimmer I made the decision to plug it in. I didn't let myself deviate from that decision. I let my body perform the action and plugged in the appliance. 

This was 5 days ago and more often than not since it happened I have been struggling with guilt and anxiety. It is sometimes overwhelming. I blame myself for being negligent and careless when purposefully plugging in an appliance that I felt was still wet. I am taking personal responsibility for taking a potentially dangerous risk. I blame myself for letting the stress and frustration from performing the compulsion cloud my thinking and weaken my resolve to the point where I did not care anymore and thought ""screw it I am just going to plug this in while it still wet"" regardless of the outcome.

I keep thinking to myself, why didn't I just continue drying the trimmer and remove the water that felt was still on it's surface?.

Why did I let frustration and stress enable me to perform what I felt was a risky action? Even if the risk was small I still made a decision in spite of the risk and could have taken further action to minimize that risk.

In general I could not be sure that the urges were not completely devoid of malicious intent. 

As I continued drying the appliance and began considering the fact that I may be ready to move on with plugging it in I eventually felt some water on the base of the trimmer. At this point, instead of continuing to dry the trimmer I made the decision to plug it in. I didn't let myself deviate from that decision. I let my body perform the action and plugged in the appliance. 

This was 5 days ago and more often than not since it happened I have been struggling with guilt and anxiety. It is sometimes overwhelming. I blame myself for being negligent and careless when purposefully plugging in an appliance that I felt was still wet. I am taking personal responsibility for taking a potentially dangerous risk. I blame myself for letting the stress and frustration from performing the compulsion cloud my thinking and weaken my resolve to the point where I did not care anymore and thought ""screw it I am just going to plug this in while it still wet"" regardless of the outcome.

I keep thinking to myself, why didn't I just continue drying the trimmer and remove the water that felt was still on it's surface?.

Why did I let frustration and stress enable me to perform what I felt was a risky action? Even if the risk was small I still made a decision in spite of the risk and could have taken further action to minimize that risk.

How can I hold myself in a high regard ever again? Do I deserve to be happy and do I deserve to be free from worry? Decision Guilt",591,2,593,0.126,0.808,0.067,-0.9845

t2_15db7sre,"Within the last year I’ve been diagnosed with both depression and generalized anxiety disorder. From what I can tell I’ve been dealing with this stuff since I was in middle school, and from then it’s been a series of highs and lows. However, the last 2 years have been really rough, and I’ve started seeking professional help. 

OCD was actually brought to my attention by a friend of mine (who is diagnosed with OCD). I remember I was talking about my feelings of unnecessary guilt and the need to incessantly apologize and “fix” it. I would feel the need to apologize or do something in order to not ruin my good relationship with the person. He compared this thought cycle to the OCD circle and since then I’ve been extremely concerned with whether or not I have OCD or not. It’s like a feeling of genuineness and like I’m faking it for the sake of being different or quirky. I’ve done as many online tests as I can think of. When the answer say “yes, you may have OCD” I feel like I’ve over exaggerated my answers or that the conclusion couldn’t possibly be true. However, when it says “no,” I’m not satisfied and try to find another test. I’ve recently started doing this again after someone told me that I was being obsessive, and I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I feel so guilty because of this though, I feel as though I am a bad person for making things up and lying about my mental state, so bad that I’m afraid to mention it to my doctor. 

Additionally, I would say I am WAY to obsessed with my relationship. I do have a lot of feelings for this friend of mine, and nearly every interaction I have with them is extremely anxiety inducing. I always fear as if I will mess up and profusely apologize for things, even if nothing is wrong, or ask if everything is ok, for the sake of feeling as if the relationship isn’t ruined. I feel as though if I say it enough times, it will be fixed. If I ask him enough times and out enough effort into making sure everything is ok, then everything will be ok. I keep stressing over these small flaws in our relationship. Furthermore, though we are not currently dating, we had been previously, and I always make up scenarios in my head to see if we are still compatible, if I still love him, if he still loves me, if we would work out in a long term relationship, if we could potentially live together, be married etc. I go down these thought paths and try and plan everything out and make sure that it is still possible. Also, I feel as if I were to start seeing someone new I wouldn’t have feelings and would definitely stress out if the relationship wasn’t as “good” or if I could have an ideal perfect relationship. 

Also, I should mention that around the time I was 10-12 I remember having a lot of thoughts surrounding harm. I remember seeing myself with knives, scooping eyes out with spoons, a so on... I don’t particularly remember if it caused any significant anxiety or stress though, so I’m not sure if this is OCD either. But it did lead me to think for a decent amount of time that I was a closeted sociopath, which led me again to take a load of online psychopathy and EQ tests to make sure I was functioning normally. Since then, I do feel sometimes that I can have behaviors linked with being a sociopath or narcissist p so I try not to talk about my achievements too much and have questioned others if they think I’m bad or able to work normally, like as a person. Lately though, I feel as though these thoughts are coming back, but every time I think about them I can’t be sure if it’s on purpose to make myself “fit in” with an OCD diagnosis or if they are involuntary thoughts. But what I’ve been doing is repeating phrases to myself to make sure that they don’t happen in real life. For example, this morning I had a feeling that I would be decapitated, so I made sure to cover the back of my neck and say to “please don’t cut off my head” until I felt that it was ok again. That’s just one example, I wouldn’t say I spend multiple hours doing this though. This goes again with, I’m not sure if what I’m thinking is self-induced to purposely fit a diagnosis or if I actually may have OCD, and it’s really driving me crazy. 

Lastly, I’ve had a skin picking habit since before I can remember, and often find that I get lost in doing this and it can go on for quite a long time. I’m not sure if this is an anxiety response or a compulsive thing.

Thanks for reading this if you got this far! I really would like to know if this sounds consistent with OCD or if it just seems like im being performative or fishing for a diagnosis. Whichever answer I get, i probably won’t be satisfied with it and will definitely doubt it and try and make sure if it is correct or not. I go completely back and forth, I feel as though I may have OCD, but then the next hour I feel as if it’s all made up in my head and I start to question if I’m telling the truth to myself or not.

t2_1xd73g0w,"Hi all,

I was on Sertraline (Zoloft) for over a decade for depression/anxiety/OCD, but recently switched to trying Viibryd because of the sexual side effects common to all SSRIs (anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation, decreased libido, etc.).

The cross we bear is heavy. The cards we have been dealt with are harsh. The OCD brain disorder we suffer is annoying and time consuming at its best and brutally punishing at its worst. This doubting disease drives us right up to the edge of our sanity. It leaves us mentally and emotionally exhausted daily and we often become shells of our former selves in the process. The depression we suffer sucks away at our energy and pulls us towards a bottomless and hopeless pit. In addition, there is a lack of awareness in society. Either we are stigmatized for being ""crazy"" or we are told to just get over it. In some cultures, OCD and depression aren't even recognized or acknowledge as real medical diseases. 

I don't know who needs to read this. But I want to remind all of us that we are so strong for enduring all this. For those in the thick of their OCD, you are strong for just enduring all the pain and suffering. Sometimes surviving to see the next day is enough. For those who are working in treatment to fight it, you are strong for confronting your greatest fears even in the midst of crippling anxiety.

t2_433xt27i,"As i recall, I've pretty much had intrusive thoughts at some point in my life but was never bothered by them. Starting last December i unexpectedly had a horrible thought which led me to believe that i was a bad person who wanted to do horrible things. This was followed by great shame and guilt which made me question myself regularly: Am i a bad person?, what does this thought says about me? Am i a psychopath? What would make a person think this? The thoughts would make me become obsessed for days or weeks at a time as i would try desperately to make it stop. I would spend hours and hours reading about intrusive thoughts and ocd online, then i started to tell my bf about the thoughts to which he said that it was normal and everyone has them. However this only made me feel relieved temporarily. As soon as i got over one bad thought i was hit with something worst. My intrusive thoughts included *what ifs* such as: what if i were a pedophile?, what if i became attracted to my family members, what if i had an urge that i couldn't control? And so much more dark horrible thoughts towards the people who i loved and cared about the most. It became worst when i started to have them during dinner, intimate moments basically anything that made me happy. My intrusive thoughts focused mostly on pedophilia, sexual and harm ocd. At one point my ocd was letting me believe that i was getting turned on by the intrusive thoughts which and me constantly check myself. Never at any time did i enjoy any of those thoughts yet i'd have what you call gronial movements. 
Tips on how i got over my ocd and intrusive thoughts:
1) Do not engage with the thought. You have an odd horrible thought- instead of questioning why you're having them just say what was that and continue doing whatever you were doing.
2) Accept the thought. This doesn't mean you have to like the thought or be okay with the bad thing. Just accept that you had a bad thought and move on.
3) know that you're not alone, we're human and our brain is constantly looking for problems to solve, distract yourself.
4) Understand that these thoughts are just your brain sending signal to you to make sure you're being careful for eg. you're walking down a stair with a knife and have an image or thought about falling and stabbing yourself. The reason for that thought is to let you be aware of what could possibly happen if you're not careful. So to avoid that you would  walk slower.
5) know that the reason you're constantly worried or feel guilty and shame of the thought is because you're afraid if you want to do it... someone who actually want to do any of those things won't feel ashamed or even think about it. 
6) know that you're not a bad person based on your thoughts, your actions and contributes toward society is what really matters.
7) understand that gronial movements because of intrusive thoughts is normal, our brain only needs to hear or think about sex and it would start sending signals to the rest of your body. It doesn't mean that you want do any of these things or what them to be done to you. 
8)Make jokes about it. 
9) know that when we die we wouldn't be remember for our thoughts or whatever we have going in in our head. People will remember us for who we really are. The person they can see and know.
10) The most important one for me is EXPOSURE.. for an entire year i stayed away from my nieces because i was afraid i would hurt them.. just a few days after i started being around them my intrusive thoughts were just thoughts, they didnt matter to me, i realized i wasn't the person in my thoughts, i stopped living in my head and started living in the present. 
Scared of being a pedophile? Go take a walk to kids park and show your self that you can go to the park and not hurt anyone. 
We want to do the exact opposite of our intrusive thoughts, we are not bad people, our thoughts are constantly manipulating us but its been proven that no one with ocd/ intrusive thoughts has ever hurt anyone.  Bad people simply do not care. 
Think of intrusive thoughts as a bully. The more attention you give to a bully the more they will want to bull you, ignore them and they will eventually leave you alone. 
It also helped that i explain to my close family and friends about ocd, intrusive thoughts and what it's like living with it and they were all supportive, said that its normal and nothing worth ruining my life over, and that they know me and the person i am. I do still have intrusive thoughts now and again but they don't make me feel shame or guilty. It's important to understand that Instrusive thoughts are normal and each and everyone of us has them but us with ocd just have it difficult to let things go and always need reassurance but let thought be thoughts.

t2_4xdua40r,"I'm not diagnosed with OCD, but a part of me thinks I have it, because I have this weird thing, where I feel like peoples opinions are always affected by little things, and noone notices. its hard to explain, but for example lets say I realllly like a movie or something, and I tell a friend to watch it, and I keep on telling them to watch it, then eventually they see the movie, and they don't like it. instantly I think that the only reason they didn't like it is because I told them about it, maybe I hyped it up too much, maybe they just subconsciously didn't want to like it because I pestered them, etc. 

I get these thoughts about almost everything, because over the years I've noticed patterns in the way people think, and come up with their opinions. I know that your mood when you do something, affects how you perceive it, but I can't just let it go usually. I start getting a little mad, because I feel like me saying to watch something, should make my friends want to watch it, but instead its just making them hate it. its not just with movies, its like this with literally anything. Movies, Games, Shows, Food, Technology, etc.  knowing I think this way, I usually try to suggest trying something once, and don't press the issue at all, but it seems like nobody wants to follow my suggestions, unless I suggest it multiple times, but then they usually don't like what I suggest, and I cant help but think its because their opinion was influenced wrongly..if that makes sense. 

Another problem I have, is usually when people actually say their opinion, if its a negative opinion, I see nothing but flaws in it..maybe they said it as if it was a negative in this one scenario, but on a different day, they expressed it as a positive view, about something they like, and just didn't remember...I am diagnosed with ADHD, so my mind does tend to think 1000 MPH, but I literally cant stop thinking about certain things, like: maybe my friends all hate me, maybe they just don't want to like what I like, maybe they were somehow influenced by the majority and just conformed, maybe they were just in a bad mood, maybe they just need to experience (X) again....I really hate thinking this way, but I literally in my head argue with the person, and think of everything they would say in specific scenarios, and why they probably just want to hate. 

Now I know this isn't always the case, and I reason with myself most of the time, but to me, if I don't like something, I KNOW its probably because of the mindset im in at the time, because I used to hate practically everything, and upon giving things a second try I usually sway my opinion, what I notice about most other people, is that if they say something, then it is set in stone. I've seen so many people say that they hate (X) when they're like 10, and then all these years later, they still say the same thing, for the same reason...and I just wonder if they even have tried it again since then? Have they just not thought about it, and are so used to saying they hate it, that its just second nature? do they just chose to hate it because it makes them more unique or something? it goes on and on and on in my head, until I finally decide to say something about it to them.

Let me assure anyone reading this, that I think for the most part I act normal in conversation, and i'm usually not very confrontational about my thoughts, but with my closer friends, it eats at me until I say what I think to them. I want to reach some sort of common ground, and I want to understand why they think the way they do. I've gotten into plenty of heated debates over things I'm very passionate about, to the point where I've lost friends. usually of my choice, because the way I see it is, if a friend doesn't like anything you like, you just end up reaching brick walls in conversation, they don't want to relate with you, they don't want to do anything but hate it seems. so I stop talking to them because I cant take the stress of people hating everything.

heres a good example of how a typical encounter like this goes, ill say something like, hey dude, you should check out this show, its really funny, and I love the actors in it. they'll say something like, oh I hate anything with this actor in it, so I don't want to watch it (insert brick wall)   ill say something like, oh well if you look past that, I think you'd actually like this show, its hilarious, and im looking for someone to watch it with. then they proceed to come up with more reasons why they probably wouldn't like the show, instead of actually watching it, and it gets me heated to the point where I tell them I think their opinion is disingenuous, and if they didn't want to hate it, they wouldn't, blah blah blah. this specific scenario hasn't really happened to me, but its a good example of how things usually end up anyway.

I want to know if this might be part of OCD, or if anyone else with OCD has experienced similar things. I genuinely think I have a ""better"" outlook on things, than anyone I know...not to sound selfish, but I just think there's no reason to hate things for these dumb reasons people come up with, and it just feels like everyone just will come up with any reason they can to hate on things... please tell me I'm not alone with thinking this way.

I have been told by other healthcare members that I just have to go out and for a walk. I always think ""they are right"" I agree to start walking but as far as I get is to the bus stop to drop my son off to be picked up for school. throughout the day I think of the walk. Mainly the reasons I shouldn't go. Too hot, too cold, and fear of just being looked at. stops me.  My wife is thin and feels like I'm the big lumped changed to her leg. Even when she tells me otherwise.  


Sorry, I'm sure I have gone on much further than needed.  I just need someone to say if they were able to lose weight or now.  


thank you. While taking Clomipramine",300,3,303,0.089,0.843,0.069,-0.7105

t2_1rl4t8f5,"Hi friends! 

I recently (a few months ago) moved to a new city. I’m from the suburbs and have lived in a small city before, but I moved to a large one about 8 or 9 hours away from my family driving distance. 

My OCD had been well-managed. I’m on an SSRI, had attended therapy for nearly 3 years, and everything felt good as far as OCD was concerned. But when I moved things changed big time. And I know the stress of the move and trying to settle in is probably playing a large part in this but it’s really making me hate living here (and I have to, for at least another two years, for graduate school). 

I just feel dirty all the time. Going out into the world has felt near impossible because I know that when I get back l’ll have to go through various compulsions to get myself to feel clean again (including long ass exhausting showers). I can’t eat or sleep until I shower, either. (And I share one bathroom with 3 other girls so sometimes I have to wait a bit.) My bedroom feels like the only safe spot. 

I’ve finally found a new therapist. It takes me about an hour to get to her office but it’s worth it, I think.

OCD about coloring hair to the point of ruining it

Has anyone else dealt with OCD over hair dye? I feel compelled to dye my hair way more than anyone should. It's thin, dry, brittle and seems to be shedding a lot more than normal. I had natural brown hair for years, but about 2-3 years ago I started dying it and have done it compulsively since. I've been dying my hair a different color roughly every two months since then, but there were times where I did it more often. 

I got my hair done less than 3 weeks ago and I want so badly to color it again. But it's so dry and thin and it really can't take much more. I know it sounds funny, but I just want to go to the store and buy a box of hair dye to make my stupid brain shut up. I think about coloring my hair every single day and spend a lot of time looking at photos of women with crazy colored hair, reading about hair dye, etc. 

At this point it feels like the only solution would be to shave my head. My hair used to be so beautiful and now it's thin and dry as all hell. I really don't know how to stop. There's no way I could go 6-12 months until my hair grows out enough to trim off all the dyed parts. It looks horrible as it grows out. 

Some background: I used to pull my hair out compulsively as a child. I forgot the name for it, trich-something. So this isn't my first OCD experience with hair...

t2_fm2t5,"Would I say I had a debilitating OCD, yes for a time, but true OCD overall?  No.  But I experienced panic when I never had in my mid 20s, and it started the loop as old as human history when it comes to connecting intrusive thoughts to body or pain signals.  When I experienced that panic it's like it took a snapshot of how my body was engaged at that moment, and linked the two.  Lasted several years, and it still affects me a tiny bit (but we are humans, a good life experiences regular intrusive thoughts too, I believe), but I see it for exactly what it is on all sides, so it means nothing to me.  I realized it was always part of my thinking, it just came to fruition in a bad way.  Now I literally have manual control over how I imagine things, and pretend something pops up, I can just physically and mentally jump past it, even explore it if I want.  I'm very much into questioning myself, but not too much.  Important to do things you don't usually do, to see how you put yourself in a position to experience similar thoughts or tensions over and over.

In mid 20s I was in bad health, just not good.  Mentally, physically.  Decided to spark up a bowl of marijuana, intrusive thought, panic, didn't have the tools, plus bad health...spiral of not being able to help myself.  Never happened before.  And I didn't know what to do, and I hide it.  Just sheer panic for a month that then lasted 2 years in some form.

One thing I learned is that, for me, it was all connected to a bodily tension.  A little NSFW, but it came down to my right side of my body, my teeth (biggie), my arm, my lung, my left side of jaw actually, and my private.  It was my whole body, but some parts were worse than others.  And when you engage something wrong, and it's in pain, your mind uses it a sign that you want to engage the parts of the brain associated with the body part.  So, for example, let's say my private parts were engaged wrong and I couldn't hit the off switch, and it felt like a slow hum of sexual tension (even though it was just tension).  Of course my body is then going to throw out sexual thoughts and pain thoughts together.  It throws out sexual thoughts when my private is engaged in a healthy way.  That's how it works.

And that obviously causes all kinds of bad body signals and loss of control over yourself.  You are the vessel, and that's important to remember.  Your body should not feel like a stranger, it should feel like...you.  Every inch of it.

And I learned that those physical cues were actually just straight up pain or my body yelling at me to reengage certain muscles.  Especially my lungs and diaphragm  (which maybe has something to do with the marijuana?).  Once I learned it had to do with facial tension, not engaging my diaphragm properly for my lungs, I just worked on it.  Now I engage my body in such...neutral ways...sometimes I feel like I'm high on something, because the way I feel myself I've never experienced before.  Just pillows of air.  I used to breathe literally through my nose, now I breathe from my diaphragm, so my awareness is in my torso, and not in my head.  It's amazing how everything I've experienced is based on what body tensions I chose naturally.  I've never felt the way I do now.  It's why we're all so different, but our bodies are very similar.

What I found is that the exact tension I would go into during OCD days or moments, would relieve itself in exactly the right way when I relaxed properly.  Let my body go into autopilot mode correctly.  There's insane luck involved when trying to reengage muscles you haven't engaged in a long time...you need to put yourself in situations where it can happen.  Remember you are built as a human being to use all your muscles all the time, when you don't they will tense up on you over periods of time, trying to get the exercise they want.

As bad as it all was, it taught me a lot.  And I think it propelled me to a place I wouldn't have gotten to otherwise.  I wonder if I had never had that panic attack, if I would have continued all my bad habits until death.

I was googling things like ""dysphagia"" at work, trying to ease my mind. I became worried that I would start choking on food and in my sleep. The day before my ""accident"", I literally laid down on my bed and started drooling onto a napkin like an idiot. 

I had other problems at the time. I had very bad neck pain for several months. I was sleeping less, like a lot less. Because of my insomnia my heart rate would randomly skyrocket when I walked. 

Day of my ""accident"" I decided to go to an ENT, who suggested going to the hospital because of my heart rate. I said yes and ended up in an ER. I thought I was ""safe"" ER asked if I wanted the procedure the ENT would do and I said yes. So for 20 minutes they put camera through my nose shoved it down my throat. It was painful. I really regret it. I don't know what they did it in there. Biggest mistake of my life.

The next few days I went in-patient at a mental hospital because I felt like I had completely lost control of my life. They didn't help me at all, it was pretty traumatizing. My blood pressure was high, and I felt like I was having a heart attack everyday. Things didn't settle down until I saw my old psychiatrist and took seroquel, putting me to sleep.

Since my procedure, I feel like I have to strain to use my voice, and I get throat pain from time to time. It's better than it was 2 months ago, but I kick myself everyday over what I've done.

I've seen 2 ENTs since who found everything to be normal. And I saw speech therapist who wasn't concerned. I just wish I felt normal and unconcerned myself.

t2_54qid20m,"Multiple possible triggers abound in this post. I'm new, and since I'm getting my very first psychiatric evaluation tomorrow, I wanted to share some of what I've been experiencing these past few months; if for no other reason just to feel less like an alien suffering in silence. Since my brain is screaming at me not to talk about my obsessions on this sub, that's *exactly* what I'm going to do.

So I haven't been actually diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, and it's why throughout this post I want to refer to my troubling symptoms as ""obsession(s)"" instead of ""my OCD."" However, I would be extremely surprised to be told, after a proper evaluation, that I DON'T have this disorder. The hand washing until my skin cracked and bled when I was 14 was the most obvious obsession I've had, but I've come to realize through reading here and research that most of mine have been the unseen type.

I don't want to make this too long and rambling so I'll get with the current issues I've face during the past two months. It started back in late September with a sudden, severe panic attack. I had to go to the ER. The panic began when I noticed an odd sensation in my head that I have a hard time describing, but I got this thought something like ""I'm about to lose touch with myself and I won't make it back"" and it sent me into the attack. As you can probably guess, days after that it became my obsession.

It's vague, but the best I can describe it is it's this fear that my brain can ""shutdown"" almost like a computer. There isn't much rationalizing going on with the fear, but ultimately when I ""ask"" the obsession how this would be possible it simply says because my brain will be shut off by my own troubled thinking and anxiety. I told off this obsession and it actually left for all but two weeks. Next thing I knew I was obsessing again after reading about repressed memories due to trauma. A similar theme to the ""shutdown"" theme emerged; this time taking the form of pure mental anguish could make me go crazy.

That theme stuck around a week and then evolved into something extremely bizarre. It evolved after I kept telling it that those things I read were theories and that any mental problems are treatable. Next thing I know the obsession tells me that it can't be treated because my brain is going to start becoming afraid of literally everything, even treatment.

This fear of everything then soon faded on its own, only to leave a vague, all consuming ""threat"" in its place that I'll never be able to be happy or enjoy myself. And at that I'm done describing these past two months of evolving themes because it's getting long and exhaustive. Basically what's going on now is the shutdown theme made its way back after returning during a panic attack last night, and I've lost almost all ability to cope with it.

I don't even know what's going on in my head right now. I feel distant, like I'm floating outside of myself. I'm also developing this fear that I'm going to start distrusting anything I think about because all my thoughts do is turn into obsessions for one reason or another. I feel like a stranger in my own MIND. I honestly don't expect to get an OCD diagnoses anytime soon since I'm using an assistance program to get any treatment to begin with, and I'm in a small town with not many specializing in anything; much less OCD.

is it like the relief of giving yourself reassurance, just without the reassurance.. you just learn how to deal with it? idk if that makes sense. im just confused and scared of what will happen or what i will do because of my thoughts. im only 17 and im afraid if i do get used to my thoughts and have them for a long time that i might actually end up killing someone i love or that i will become a serial killer, cannibal, school/mass shooter, etc.. im so scared ill become one of those in the future. idk what to do besides reassure myself. i cant sit here with these thoughts and “accept” them, they make me feel crazy, of course. i know thats what recovery is about, but recovery doesnt even seem possible.

So I've had social anxiety for a long long time and I'm currently 16. I know that when left untreated (which I have been doing literally nothing in terms of medication and therapy) that anxiety can develop into OCD but (this is the embarrassing part) I watched The Aviator which is one of my favorite movies. if you haven't seen it it's about Howard Hughes a very brilliant who suffered horribly from OCD and after I watched the movie I would sort of ""mock"" him.

t2_4v2jo20e,"What’s up reddit fam, fellow individual here diagnosed with OCD. I have been on meds (Prozac) and therapy for a little over a year now. Just wanting to get some things off my chest especially at times where I feel like there’s no one I can relate to. I hope somebody can read through it all and that it doesn’t take up much of your time :)

A bit of info on myself is that I’m an 18 year-old male first-year engineering student straight out of high school. I’m very introverted to the point where I isolate myself and refuse to see people until I have become the person that I “want” to be. I haven’t been going to school recently except just showing up for labs and exams.

The purpose of me making this post is that I have some habits that have been eating at me despite being in therapy trying to stop them for over a year. I understand they are very shallow and I am trying my best to stop them.

1. I walk around my living room in circles for hours in a day (collectively, not simultaneously) listening to music and daydreaming. I get hyped up where I’m imagining myself as an alpha male living the ideal life I wish I had. This includes me being surrounded and talked about with women and respected amongst my peers, having lots of money, wearing designer clothes, being the child of wealthy affluent people, a basketball star, etc. Think of Fight Club where Edward Norton created this character he wishes he was if it helps you understand what I’m taking about.

2. My OCD makes me either insanely insecure or extremely egotistic. I have become a shopaholic spending thousands of dollars buying designer clothes because I feel like people will judge me for wearing normal Nike’s or even eating in a cafeteria. I used to be made fun of as a kid for wearing the same clothes every day, and now that I’ve earned money by hustling, the only way that I can ever be myself is if I’m seen in designer clothes. That’s because then I feel like people will think “Wow look at him, he got style” and then it doesn’t really matter what I do at that point because I’m “that cool guy” with designer clothes. When I’m wearing “normal” clothing, I get panic attacks for even just walking in public. But then when I wear designer clothes, I feel like I want the entire world to look at me. There’s never a middle ground where I can go through my day normally and not care about looks. 

3. I constantly ruminate and spend hours trying to convince myself I’m not a pedophile, a rapist, a racist, and etc. for simply having intrusive thoughts that convince me I am otherwise. I’ve had experience with women and I have never forced any action beyond their consent. I may have done a little “cmon babe it’ll be fun” at times, but never to the point where they said no and I did it anyway. I always made sure there was a yes before any action I took. Yet simple things like this affect me for months on end and makes me feel like a rapist. I’ve never said the N word to anyone or excluded someone because of their beliefs/appearance, or had any interest ever in pre-pubescent children.

4. I constantly repeat conversations in my head and talk to people all the time in my mind. Sometimes it gets to the point I laugh out loud in private or utter some of the words going on in my head.

I feel like there is a monster living in my head. I want to do well in my studies and have fun socially, but my biggest enemy and problem is my OWN MIND,

t2_xahil,"My obsessions are about bad things happening to people I love, and my main compulsion is checking the time to see if there is a 6 in it. I only look at the last digit, the hour doesn't matter.  

So I'll say ""if there's no 6 in the time everything is fine"" and a lot of times there would be a 6.  

Sometimes I change it to another number, sometimes I say ""if it changes to 7 now, its true"" and it will change to 7.  

I'm convinced something bad is going to happen, something specific and I cant stop thinking about it.  

I'm having trouble knowing its ocd and not a superpower to prevent things from happening.  

My ocd wants me to agree to this thought and ""give up"" my mom or sister.  

I've been fighting every day and it's so hard.  

I worried that these thoughts are intuition and not ocd, that my gut is trying to tell me things, and when I check the time it's like it confirms the thoughts.  

I've had coincidences before 
- I got in trouble for piracy and was afraid of going to jail so my ocd said ""you won't go to jail but your boyfriend will break up with you"" so I agreed, and I didn't go to jail and he broke up with me.  
- My aunt called one night and said she didn't know how long my grandma had to live. I was playing the sims and trying to starve the old people. My ocd said ""if you do it your grandma will die"" I ignored it and she died the next day.  
- Today I said ""I'd rather have my glasses break than lose my mom or sister"" today I accidentally broke my glasses  

There are other coincidences but I'm not allowed to talk about them.  

But these thoughts feel so real and I'm worried that its intuition and that something is trying to tell me something, like sometimes it feels like I'm grieving in advance.   

I just need someone to convince me its ocd and typing this right now my ocd is saying ""you know it's not ocd""  
I feel so numb and I feel like I accidentally agreed to letting these thoughts happen.  
It almost feels like I ""gave up my mom"" and I'm scared because of the other coincidences and I'm just so defeated and I dont know what to do.  
Every day I feel like this but never this much, maybe it's because I accidentally agreed by failing a compulsion and not fixing it or because every time I look at the time it's a number I say it cant be (3 6 or 9) so it's like the time is telling me there's nothing I can do about it.  

I use the time as a yes or no thing.  
Bad number = it's true  
Good number = not true  

But I'm worried about people I love, and the specific worry I have isn't for both people, just one, and my ocd tries to tell me it's my mom, then I say no, then it says my sister, and I say no, but it feels like it's trying to get me to accept one fear to prevent the other. ""your mom and your sister won't die, but you'll go to jail""  

I just need someone's opinion and hopefully with similar obsessions. I know reassurance isn't good because its counter active but I'm not in therapy and not ready for exposure. I know things happen and can happen but I cant be told to just accept it right now. I know I need to see a doctor but I need something to help me get through.",My ocd is really bad.

I'm convinced something bad is going to happen, something specific and I cant stop thinking about it.  

I'm having trouble knowing its ocd and not a superpower to prevent things from happening.  

My ocd wants me to agree to this thought and ""give up"" my mom or sister.  

I've been fighting every day and it's so hard.  

I worried that these thoughts are intuition and not ocd, that my gut is trying to tell me things, and when I check the time it's like it confirms the thoughts.  

I've had coincidences before 
- I got in trouble for piracy and was afraid of going to jail so my ocd said ""you won't go to jail but your boyfriend will break up with you"" so I agreed, and I didn't go to jail and he broke up with me.  
- My aunt called one night and said she didn't know how long my grandma had to live. I was playing the sims and trying to starve the old people. My ocd said ""if you do it your grandma will die"" I ignored it and she died the next day.  
- Today I said ""I'd rather have my glasses break than lose my mom or sister"" today I accidentally broke my glasses  

There are other coincidences but I'm not allowed to talk about them.  

But these thoughts feel so real and I'm worried that its intuition and that something is trying to tell me something, like sometimes it feels like I'm grieving in advance.   

I just need someone to convince me its ocd and typing this right now my ocd is saying ""you know it's not ocd""  
I feel so numb and I feel like I accidentally agreed to letting these thoughts happen.  
It almost feels like I ""gave up my mom"" and I'm scared because of the other coincidences and I'm just so defeated and I dont know what to do.  
Every day I feel like this but never this much, maybe it's because I accidentally agreed by failing a compulsion and not fixing it or because every time I look at the time it's a number I say it cant be (3 6 or 9) so it's like the time is telling me there's nothing I can do about it.  

I use the time as a yes or no thing.  
Bad number = it's true  
Good number = not true  

But I'm worried about people I love, and the specific worry I have isn't for both people, just one, and my ocd tries to tell me it's my mom, then I say no, then it says my sister, and I say no, but it feels like it's trying to get me to accept one fear to prevent the other. ""your mom and your sister won't die, but you'll go to jail""  

I just need someone's opinion and hopefully with similar obsessions. I know reassurance isn't good because its counter active but I'm not in therapy and not ready for exposure. I know things happen and can happen but I cant be told to just accept it right now. I know I need to see a doctor but I need something to help me get through. My ocd is really bad.

t2_54yvifhj,"I (m18) have been lost and confused and I don't know what's going on. I don't know if I'm gay or bi or straight, or in denial, and it's been keeping me awake sometimes.

Ever since I was young, I was always attracted to girls. I get nervous around them and would dream of being with them, I would masturbate to them and would sometimes watch porn with them. I have a girlfriend I'm madly in love with and I'm attracted to her both romantically and sexually. It's worth noting that we started having sex around two months ago.

I also remember how I watched a movie a few years ago, and how it contained a gay sex scene. I thought that it must feel good being on the receiving end. Ever since then, I would sometimes think about gay sex during masturbation. Once or twice I tried to do stuff to myself down there, but I didn't like it. I never had any sexual or romantic attraction to a guy, however.

However, a month ago I seriously wondered if I was gay. I thought about me sometimes thinking of these things while masturbating, and I also thought about me being nervous around girls and not nervous around guys (I thought that I felt more comfortable with guys as a result). I started to panic as I had a girlfriend and I didn't want to lose her.

Ever since then it feels like I lost my attraction to my girlfriend, both romantically and sexually. I'm scared, as I do not want to break up with her, and I want to stay with her forever. Previously I was super attracted to her and would sometimes immediately get hard thinking about her, but now I don't. I saw a Reddit thread asking when gay people knew they were gay, and one guy commented that he tried sex with women and didn't like it. I thought about me trying sex just a month ago and started to freak out more, and i thought I didn't like it. I do get hard around her, but when I put a condom on, the erection disappears and that makes me more scared. It feels like now I can only get hard with her if she starts playing around with me, and it doesnt come naturally. I'm scared that I lost interest in her because I tried sex and I'm afraid that I don't like it for whatever reason. 

When I masturbate, I now only think about gay sex, which I despise. I keep getting thoughts - you are gay, you should break up with her because you are gay, you want to have gay sex, you don't love your gf anymore, you would love being at the bottom (despite me trying it to myself and not liking it). I'm scared because I don't want to be gay and I want to be with my girlfriend. It feels like I lost almost all of my attraction to women and it feels like my libido is at zero. and previously, when my gf went on a trip, I would miss her so much, but I don't feel that now and I'm scared. I just don't want to be gay, but I'm scared I am.

I made the stupid mistake of watching gay porn last night to see if I was aroused, and after the first minute I saw that I had  a bit of an erection, which did not help at all and made me panic. I thought of gay and straight encounters and tried to see if I was aroused or not aroused. When I see a picture of a man, I sometimes feel like it twitches down there, which I don't get with women now. Worse, when I see a man, I sometimes even think that I am holding back my erection. It feels like I get more aroused thinking about this than thinking about my girlfriend, which makes me worried.

Sorry if this is totally not what this subreddit is for and i really appreciate if you’ve read this far. My OCD is a serious struggle for me and I will no doubt be posting many more times on this subreddit, but i’m mostly excited to interact with other people with OCD and try my best to offer my own help. 

Thank you &lt;3 New type of intrusive thought for me",314,7,321,0.172,0.67,0.158,-0.5036

I’m on the hunt for more people who talk about and experience ocd, but haven’t been able to find a lot on YouTube that wasn’t different psychiatrists and therapists talking about it (which is great but not what I’m looking for).

Does anyone else have to say their thoughts out loud in order to get rid of them?

a) get the thought out of my head by saying it aloud, or

b) Distract myself by reading something aloud.

t2_509ypodi,"I’ve struggled with this for as long as I’ve had OCD.

The biggest obstacle involves learning subjects. It’s funny because I used to (and still do) fail a lot of grade school and uni classes. This was not because I had trouble understanding, not because I couldn’t motivate myself to study. No, this was because I was so obsessively focused on categorizing the information I became like stone and could not learn the rest of the material. 

The reason this has been a strength is because I can learn one type of information very well. I could be an excellent chemist, painter, physicist, electrician, if I pick one, because my brain has an easier time organizing the fields substructure rather than trying to formally align it with other unrelated subjects. I’ve done well in those subjects and I tend to like most subjects both involving humanities and STEM.

I can’t enroll in 5 classes and just go from class to class, take notes, study, do a test. I will get stuck on the first few notes, trying to write them exactly in a highly streamlined way, or understand how my art history notes have any degree of lexical and structural similarity to my physics notes.

I wish I could just mesh everything into some highly efficient, blog of chaos. It’s kinda like I’ve always admired people who can live in a cluttered house yet not only find everything but also be happy living there, while every single thing I own is meticulously placed at just the right place and I still never find anything AND I’m not happy.",Obsessive mental organization,OCD,1,e4y7gf,False,"I’ve struggled with this for as long as I’ve had OCD.
