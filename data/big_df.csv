t2_1k53nux0,"If a person triggers your ocd and causes you to have intrusive thoughts, in particular about them, that creates a great deal of mental contamination as a result. And if this person is someone in your family that you never communicate but live with, and is largely triggering due to a lot of unresolved conflicts, and complex trauma that has never been dealt with or discussed. Now, it is a holiday and by convention and tradition everyone is supposed to gather together. I honestly think it is wrong to make someone who has this problem have to interact and be 'together' like as if those problems never occurred. On one hand I feel bad for not celebrating with everyone like we did in the past, and by past I mean two years ago, but this guy is triggering to look at. His voice makes nails on a chalkboard a relaxing substitute. The way he speaks triggers a whole bunch of insecurities. He makes virtually every sound that is most aggravating, and triggering (misphonia). He isn't a bad person, but there are a lot of unresolved problems. If I left at home with only him, I cannot leave the house unless I feel like shit, otherwise I will surely get triggered in the process of letting him know I am leaving. The most contaminating, and disturbing intrusive thoughts are really memories of different creepy interactions with him. I don't know what to do. A lot of people posted about how they get anxious going to a new years party. Honestly, I would love that problem in place of this. Unless there are people at that party, or unless that party is taking place somewhere that brings you certain painful memories, if it is just anxiety, and a genie came and replaced my current issue or at least the issue I have been dealing with for the past year and a half, with that, I would consider the problem solved. It isn't completely solved, but close enough. This is a guy that has hurt me in the past and didn't apologize, as well as one I have a lot of moral debt towards I haven't paid. Both are tirggered when I see him. This is a guy that would routinely interrupt me whenever I tried to safely vent out my frustrations by punching my pillow, causing me to self harm quite a bit more. He is also someone that witnessed me self harming, spying from behind his door, while I was hitting myself in my room, only to see that he was watching me, an experience that has been burned into my memory. That memory is often one of my intrusive thoughts. This is someone that I barely ever talk to. I go about days without saying a word, and when I do it is very business like, completely emotionally withdrawn and formal. I don't hate the person, and he isn't a bad person. It's just there are a lot of unresolved problems. The intrusive thoughts were mostly diminished before going to celebrate out of ""courtesy"" bloody courtesy. Now they're back. The last time there was a simple interaction that triggered me, I couldn't get the recurring thoughts out for days. These thoughts only appeared at particular times when doing particular things, but still it took a while to get rid of them. I don't know how to live like this in this environment. I have abandoned any sense of boundaries and self care living there, because simple interactions are going to a party that makes you very insecure and anxious level internal dilemmas, but unlike the party where you can put your foot down, I can't. I would take having severe harm ocd, and working at starbucks or anywhere as tirggering as possible, over something like this. ",Person triggers me,OCD,1,abfhc9,False

t2_2nvk1ovs,"I need some thoughts.  I have done years of CBT ERP and ACT for my OCD.  I have treated it in the past with medication but am not currently taking anything.  I am struggling with severe obsessive thoughts over my boyfriend - images of him with others, thoughts that he's lying to me, thoughts that I'm not good enough, thoughts that im going to get cheated on, etc. I am a 28 yr gay male. Spending new years 
with my boyfriends family in a different on 
the other side of the country from my home. 
Tonight I broke down and tried to remove 
the last wall between us after the last few 
month ramp up of problems we have dealt 
with. 

When I met him, I was just dating to grow. I had Absolutely no intentions of finding the one. I have been working on my OCD for several years. Have not found relief in medication yet but have done lots of therapy. I knew my OCD could be a potential problem and was planning to heal it completely before settling down with someone. A little while after we decided to commit to each other, we hit a few walls that have taken some extreme amounts of work from both of us to work through. He also was not planning to settle down. But the more we have worked through these difficulties together, the more were certain we want to be together. So rocky road aside, we have been growing closer every step. 
Though I've hit a point where I cannot fight my OCD any longer. And while he has stated it has worn him down, he has short fought harder by my side than anyone else before. And has been working on his own stuff along side it as I have worked to reciprocate the help. 

To break down why my OCD has become so troublesome lately I'll provide synopsis of the events leading to this melt down. 
Several weeks after we committed to eachother, I stumbled on his porn addiction. It started by finding it on his browser by accident. When I asked him about it he initially told me he was not viewing it. When I presented the evidence to him, he claimed that he used it to get ideas for us to use for our intimacy. As time went on I continued to find evidence and ask him to be honest. I continued to tell him how important honesty was important to me, and that I did not mind the porn but wanted him to just be forthright in telling me. Everytime he refused to tell me he had used it until I had to show him the evidence. And I would then be met with defensiveness. 

Some of the responses id get were that this has always been common in previous relationships so he didn't understand why it was hurting me. I continued to explain it wasn't the porn that bothered me it was the fact that he would not be honest about it. I continued to reiterate that he could view it if he wanted but that Id just prefer he tell me and not hide it from me. I even tried to get out of my comfort zone and view it with him. But he refused to let me. After several weeks of this, it started leading me to become obsessive. The breakdown of trust started making me question more and more what was really going on. 
So I started going through his phone and uncovered how much deeper the porn problem was. He would view porn after he got home from work in the hour before I got to his house, often times Wed be intimate, and then Ild head home for the night. Only to discover the next day that he was right back onto porn sites 5 minutes after I had left. Again Id ask him to be honest and he would never tell me the truth. He even started downloading different browsers, using incognito, and etc to hide it. But I'm very skilled with computers and can usually find most anything. This is when I started having a complete lack of trust in him and got very obsessive. 

Because of my obsessions I did read and view everything. He had several explicit pictures of people saved to a Google drive (He hadn't saved anything to the drive since feb 2017) He still had contscrs from grinder and tinderon his phone with one person listed as ""bad in bed - do not hookup"". 
So time passed. We continued to address him needing to be honest with me through the porn stuff. Finally, atleast based on the fact that I can no longer find it, the porn has stopped. And he claims he is no longer viewing it. So now it seems he's being honest, because I cannot find it any longer on his phone/computer. Up until it disappeared though, he never once told me he had viewed it, even when I was sitting there with his browser history in my hand, until I showed him the proof.  However after discussion he finally told me he was trying to stop but was afraid of telling me because we had only been dating a short time at this point and he didn't want to break up with me over it. So he said he was trying to hide it while he used it less and less so that he could stop the addiction and not hurt me. So he said he was scared about telling me when he used it because he was ashamed. 

We talkrd a lot about rebuilding the honesty. He shared his sexual history with me, including details and numbers. Because at this point I was so obsessed with fixing this lack of trust and eliminating all the fears the previous obsessions had exposed. This is where things got more difficult. Because the history he shared with me did not match what his texts told me. He told me he had never slept with more than one person at a time. And he told me this multiple times. But because he never deletes messages, I read conversations with his friends where he texted about just having his first three some. He went into details with them about how it happened who they were, how weird one guy was for saying bro so much. And then about having his friends pick him up so he didn't have to have an Uber. I mean the conversation was very detailed. 

There were also conversations about him getting tricked into going to a sex club and having a party time. Again incredibly descriptive from how many rooms there were to what kind of things were in each room. He even included the details of being convinced it was a Waterpark so he showed up in a swimsuit and was embarrassed. 

On top of all that, there were freaking exchanges about how his life is just working and fucking. And times hed text his friends about just having the worst hookop of his life. And then conversations about how the last 4 guys couldnt last more than a few minutes. 
So obviously you guys understand how badly that started ramping up my ocd. He lied to me about the porn for 2 months. He told me his sexual history was more conservative and that he had never been to the sex club. And he didn't do hookups. Etc. 

So when I finally presented him with the evidence from the texts, he broke down and said that he was never being dishonest. That he never did those things in the texts, but continued to reassure me that the numbers be told me were correct. That he had not ever had a threesome or orgy or had gone to a sex club.  He said that he texted those things to seem cool. Because he was trying to keep up a facade or character of someone cool to his friends. He continues reassure me that all of those texts were just ways for him to feel validated when he was lonely and feeling worthless. 

Because he wanted to seem cool. And he said that a lot of those details were things heheard from people and so it made it easy to fabricate stories that made him feel cool. 
Now as the weeks started leading up to him bringing me here to his hometown for new years, my ocd has been going insane. Being back here where all these people from his 
contacts are. And where all the stuff written about in those texts would have happened if they actually did. 

I want to believe him that he was hurting andinsecure and trying to sound cool over texts, but as you guys understand, my ocd keeps sending me thought after thought. And possibility after possibility that he is still lying to me. And still hiding it from me. 
After weeks of asking for reassurance and explaining to him my need for truth and affirmation and everything that I need to feel secure in the relationship I still feel like he's lying to me. 

He said he has stopped using porn completely cold turkey - without me asking him to, I was simply asking for honesty. Because he says he enjoys saving it for our intimacy and recognizes that he was obsessed and had been wanting to break free. 
He deleted all his contacts - without me asking him to. He said he didn't even really think about them being there, and when we got into the relationship he just didn't think about it. 

He deleted his snapchat - without me asking him to. Because he said there were too many contacts to just delete them individually, he doesn't use it. And didn't want to have people randomly message him in the future. 

He deleted all the explicit pictures, to his credit on this one, they were in a Google drive that had not been touched in two years. So I can believe him when he said they were old and he had forgotten about them. 

He has been touchy and affirming. He has continued to try and be proactive in telling me that those texts were all about show and didn't really happen. He continues to stand firm that his sexual history is exactly what he has told me. 

He came forward and told me that he has never had his drivers license, but was too embarrassed to tell me that because he liked me so much when we met. So he had originally told me that it had just lapsed. The reason he doesn't have his license is because he has severe ptsd from several car accidents when he was younger. 

But now I am stuck - my ocd keeps bringing the intrusive thoughts of him being this person who was fucking a hookup every few days or enjoying thresomes. And because the numbers he has told me were fairly higher than I had hoped, it continues to bring up images of all these different people. I feel like I can't trust him. I can't just believe what he's told me about those texts. And I don't know why I can't become mindful over these images this time. I had my ocd pretty much under control before this. 

I know that I love hm. And I know ne loves me. I can see the work he has been putting in. I can understand that he has his own mental problems to work through because of years of sexual abuse when he was little. I can see that he is trying to work on him and support me. He has taken ownership of lying to me about the porn. And he has said he is obviously telling me the Truth about his sexual history not linking with the texts, because it would be easier for him to just say yes all those texts are true. Because that would help show me to trust him better. It would stop me from questioning him more. But he said he will lot lie to me anymore, and so unfortunately he must continue to stand firm that the texts were just to make him look cool and thst he will accept having to continue to give me reassurance and work through this. Rather than lie and say they're true to just end the discussion. He also told me that because I didn't leave him after all the lying with the porn and holding strong until we resolved it, I showed him I was finally the one person he could trust with everything - he could tell me anything no matter how much it might hurt in the moment and that he was willing to be completely raw and honest with me because I had broken down that Wall and he felt like he no longer needs to lie to protect himself because I'm not gonna hurt him with the truth. 
I know I'm stuck in my head fiightjng all this. I can't see it all as I need to. 

It does looks like he's being honest now, doesn't it? 
It does appear he's stopped porn, right? 
It does appear he's acknowledged that he messed up and has gone more than the extra mile to clean up his behavior, right? 
If that's all correct. Then it is up to me to get these thoughts under control and heal so we can continue to build our relationship. We both want to work through this. We're not even close to the door. We in fact have been able to recognize the unhealthy aspects and want to heal them together as a team. But where do I start now? I am lost, overwhelmed by these images, and tired of fighting against the thoughts. I don't want to break up with him. Because I do recognize were not all perfect and he is trying to fix things.

Fingers bent, intertwined with my hair, pushing it upwards. My eyes closed tightly, feeling as though the weight of the world is seated precariously on my eyelids. My racing thoughts like a pendulum, forcing my body to rock forward and back for what feels like eternity. Perspiring, heart - palpitating and tears, welling up. I am a personal catastrophe.

t2_2n3a26ba,"Hi so a bit of context. I have had a long history (half my life) of coming into odds with people who cannot comprehend my condition and therefore refuse to respect certain boundaries.

One of these is one my triggers which happens to be talking about a particularly topic of my personal life which is easily avoidable in any conversation with friends and family. Unfortunately throughout my life my family has been a big pain about this as most couldn't grasp the concept of my mental illness and therefore refused to oblige which resulted in me moving away several times, refusing to talk to certain members, and generally limiting interaction with them whatsoever.

I never really had this problem with my friends as they're usually more understanding and as I said, it's a personal topic which my friends usually ignore and don't particularly care about. 

Two years ago, I started hanging out with a new group. They're incredibly nice people but unfortunately they're not particularly bright. Now I say this without any pretentiousness at all. The reason I'm mentioning it is because they have an even harder time comprehending my condition than my family ever did but for the most part it didn't affect me until last night after the countdown. They kept hammering on about this particular part of my personal life despite my objections to switch topics. Some didn't take iy seriously and couldn't understand why I didn't want to talk about it so they laughed. Anyway, the closest person to me realised I was upset and apologised and promised to never bring it up but unfortunately now I still can't stop obsessing about it. The sad part is they can't really comprehend the problem they've caused me no matter how hard I try to explain. It's a completely alien concept detatched from anything they've experienced in life. So this situation may happen again despite their well intentions. I'm frustrated because this has been something that's been plaguing me with family half my life and I needed my friends to help me escape from that not further reinforce it.

Since then I googled 24/7 about the symptoms during some weeks and I absolutely fear I am going crazy. I became hyper sensitive and started to monitoring the environment around me. My hearing was increased and I felt like I was going to hallucinate every seconds.  But fortunately it's over now. But I made that mistake after this. I've been contacted with an old friend who is truely schizophrenic and asked about the beginning symptoms of the illness. He said that his first symptom was that whenever he heard and saw talking people he belied that the people are talking about him. From this point I also started to believe in some cases the people are talking about me. I know that it is bullsh\*t, but this is the first thing what pops out in my mind. Then I think that ""OMG it's crazy, it's not true, I know that! But what's happening to me, I am going out of realiy?"" Then I become scared and anxious. I DON'T want to be schizophrenic! :( How should I cope with these ""pop-up thoughts""?

I am in contact with a clinical psychologist and she confirmed that I am not(and will not be) schizophrenic. But she every time just scream that: Stop it! Stop this stupidity now!"".

t2_2n56p9te,"I literally can’t even come to terms to what I did in regards to my ocd ritual. About a month ago I got curious about this dead coaxial cable in one of the bedrooms in our house. I thought it would be a good idea to inspect it so I touched it. Worst mistake of my life. Let me tell you it only escalated to putting in my mouth alongside being wet . I would continue doing this compulsion for about a month or so when I realized that it might be a good idea to increase the shock level(fear I mean). 

So forks are conductors right? So I placed in the dead coaxial cable and nothing of course until my brain decided i had to place th tip of the fork in my mouth and the other side on the dead coaxial end. It only gets worse. The next day I was plagued by the fact that since I utilized a fork that I wouldn’t be able to look at metal or culinary tools again. So I decided to wet the floor and myself to increase my comfort level. I did the ritual with the wet floor and pants and the fork in my mouth. Nothing happened obviously but I feel horrible and disconnected from the world.

t2_2wms380b,"Just want to say I’m not officially diagnosed yet as I couldn’t get a mental health referral until 2 weeks from now but I’ve been suffering with what I’m 99% sure is Pure O for the last month or so, and have had OCD-like episodes since I was a kid. I’m so scared to post about this as literally no one knows about all this except my boyfriend.

This all started with confession compulsions of what my brain considered to be “bad” things I’ve said/done/thought in my past to my current boyfriend. This escalated in the last month to ROCD, which led to me discovering that I’m likely an OCD sufferer, since i seem to fit pure O symptoms. After reading on this sub I discovered the other themes that OCD can present itself as, and this is when I discovered that POCD is a thing. After reading about it, I thought it sounded like one of the worst themes someone could have and hoped I would never experience it. So of course after that it was all I could think about, and suddenly my intrusive thoughts turned away from my boyfriend and towards children. I was disgusted with some of the things my brain could come up with, but have been able to get by knowing it likely wasn’t my “true self” having these thoughts if that makes sense, since i never had them before reading about POCD and had never had any sort of sexual thoughts or attraction towards children or anyone underage before. This helped me a lot until i remembered something.

A few years back i was reading a news article about non offending pedophiles being reported to the police by their therapists despite never assaulting children, and naturally the comment section had some polarising views. I remember feeling a little sympathy strictly to non-offending pedophiles, recognising that their attraction is not a choice they make and probably cause insane distress and shame to people, and should be able to seek help before they escalate and offend (just to be clear, once someone makes the choice to seek out illegal content or assault a child, I have absolute zero sympathy as they made a choice to act on their attraction and knowingly ruined lives in the process). I worried a little that this meant I had too much sympathy for pedophiles, and out of nowhere I had a memory from around 7-8 years before when I must have been 11/12 where I was changing my infant sisters diaper and may have touched her genitals out of curiosity (TMI but I was discovering masturbation around this time and suddenly knew what a clitoris did) . I instantly felt nauseous at the idea and had panic attacks on and off all night. I considered turning myself in to the police, and very briefly wondered how I could kill myself, but snapped out of that thought in seconds. 

However, the next few days I thought it over and realised that I wasn’t even sure if this ever happened in the way I was remembering it. First of all, it allegedly happened years and years before but I only suddenly out of nowhere remembered it, but only very brief bits and pieces of memory that seemed fuzzy. Knowing how much guilt I feel over tiny things and how much I overthink things, I found it very hard to believe I could do something so awful and just forget it by literally the next day (i have no memory of any past guilt over this event occurring or recalling it before).

 I also realised I remembered the event happening in different ways as I went over it, i.e at first I thought it was outright touching, then I remembered only accidentally pressing too hard as I wiped, which led me to wondering about whether this would trigger her to start touching herself later on, which my parents would notice and I would somehow get into trouble despite it being an accident (i don’t know if that makes sense but essentially I remember the event as having happened with both deliberate touching and accidentally touching her whilst changing her). Although I’ve never been 100% certain what happened the accidental one feels more like what actually happened in my mind. I feel about 75% sure this is a false memory because of this, as I even had doubts it could have happened before I even knew false memory OCD was a thing or that OCD was anything beyond excessive cleaning and hand washing rituals. Additionally, my anxiety reaction, obsessive rumination over it and compulsions and reassurance seeking is almost identical to how I feel and act now with my current obsessions that I know are irrational. 

Most of the time I can assure myself that I know I’m not a pedophile, I didn’t touch my sister deliberately, and that my OCD is attacking the things I love the most (my family and the fact that i really want children in the future) and playing on my biggest fears. However, in the moments I’m ruminating over these it all feels real and i can’t deal with the uncertainty that I could have done this awful thing in the past, even though I know it’s unlikely. 

Is there any way I will ever know what actually happened? As i thought it over more and more in the past it gets harder to remember and sometimes I doubt whether any of it even happened at all. How can I deal with this myself until I can speak to a counsellor? How do I even begin to explain this to a counsellor without them misunderstanding thinking I am a pedophile? How do I go about seeing my family without this overwhelming anxiety and shame taking over? 

Sorry if this is long and rambly, i just wanted to include as much detail as I could so this all makes sense.

Things he says that others do as well I worry about more than what others because it is just him and for some reason I process what he says differently to others.

t2_1k2sh3a6,"hello guys! so  i developed something new. OCD like i never experienced before. im not going to mentioned the little ones but the big ones and the one that i need to reduce or eliminate completely. so the one that worries me the most is taking long showers (30 minutes and i used to do it in 10) and brushing and flossing teeth in 30 minutes. all because i constantly wash and repeat bodyparts when showering thinking it needs more cleaning or theres bubbles left. now to the big one that worries me a lot. going to bed. ive never experienced this until now, so when i go to bed  i constantly check my quilt to see if theres something or if its messy or not in “excellent” condition to use, like i watch how the lines are and if its organized if not i fix it and watch again, this takes 30 minutes and if i wake up to go to the bathroom i do the same. now the worst part. i sleep in fetto or fetal position. now when i get to bed i have to organize my clothes and feel relaxed and comfy (something i didnt used to do) and fixing the quilt so it feels comfy and when getting into fetal position if its not comfy or like i want it i go again from start and do it again. i just used to jump in bed and get into fetal position without worries. now if i dont feel comfy i just start again. i try to fight it but the anxiety was high. i got an appointment with psychologist in 20 minutes but need advice from you guys. thanks and happy new year!

 I was walking in a normal street and felt hungry. my ocd maybe has asked not to have any activity/business from any place on that specific street. like eating in a restaurant or buy from a shop. somehow I maybe have accepted that thought. I was too bored to feel anxious  so I just carefree maybe accepted the ocd thought. I do not know if I said it to God or to myself but there were some fast thoughts like ""i wont have any activity/business from any place from that street"" I should have rebuke that thought but I probably did not. I don't remember. anyway I am not sure if this is valid or not. 

  I learned that my job will be in that street that the ocd thoughts occurred. I am worried in going to work in that street as an actor because of the thoughts I maybe have accepted somehow.
 
  I decided to ignore ocd and work there. Weeks ago, according to an old post in a forum, I was wondering if God will punish me for working there. some seconds later, the video I was watching in youtube said something like ""the cardinal will punish you..."" I freaked a little cause it was like an answer to my question.

after many days I viewed that post and some minutes or hours later, I was searching a site for shirt and searching the available colors. I saw one color named cardinal red. I felt a little funny cause I read the word ""cardinal"" in my old post about the youtube quote coincidence. later, at night there was a tv ad about a movie and one of the actresses was a woman named ""Cardinale"". I worried a little more. the same day I found the word cardinal-cardinal.

I opened a forum and at that moment someone just made a new post with the title ""Cardinal O'Malley forwards concerns to Nuncio after Times bombshell on NY priest "". I freaked more cause it was posted a moment ago that I opened the site.

t2_csp63,"Its my first post in this sub, I have been diagnosed with OCD since I was very little, never got any help with it. I am now 19 years old and very recently started going to therapy and was diagnosed/acknowledged again that I do indeed still have OCD.

I barely finished school, got severely suicidal even trying once during the hardest times and even during the easier times I still felt bad, got extremely anti social, could barely sleep etc. 

Point being I have tried full time work and I have tried studying but very clearly I mentally can't handle it with how severe my OCD (and diagnosed depression) currently is so I am living at home with my brother and parents basically therapy is my only focus and its been really nice mentally, I have felt calm and relaxed at points which I haven't been for over 6 years now.

My father calls my OCD a ""silly bacteria scare"" despite me trying to explain it on several occasions and how much it impacts me. Today told me that I would have to get a job or start studying soon.

I understand I don't deserve to be spoiled simply because of my mental illness but its very clear he doesn't give a shit about my mental health. I had thought I would be given more than 2 months to try and ""fix"" my OCD but that doesn't seem to be the case.

I'm sorry for the long text but I seriously need advice, do I just bite the bullet? Move out studying or getting a job and try to hang on? Or should I beg to be given more time?

I know some people think this would be fine, but it just seems strange to me. 17 and 15 or 18 and 15 dating seems to be cutting it close. I dont want to date someone too young but it's like I cant convince myself because of her looks. I dont know how to stop stressing over this.

t2_mfcom1,"It's now been around six years since I was told I had OCD. From 2006 to 2015 I would usually have harm themes, sexual themes, superstitious themes and compulsion related to death, numbers, touching and rumination. In 2015 I developed a new theme. I started asking doubting questions like ""What if I don't actually like this/that/them?"" and I got stuck in confusion and I've been there ever since. In 2016, I developed a real life event theme and I started worrying that I had said something/done something bad in the past that I couldn't remember. These two themes rarely occured simultaenously. I would have a week where I constantly ruminated about the past trying to seek answers about what I had said when I was 14 and 20 and I felt like I could move on with my life and do things I loved if I got the answers. After some time I realized I shouldn't waste my time with that and move on and I could enjoy things in my life, but then I would  get the other doubts again ""do I really like eating chocolate bars?"" and start worrying about that, these two themes would co-exist and feed off of each other.   


A year ago I decided to get into therapy again, it had only been half a year since I had been in therapy. My therapist had tried to get me into an OCD program, but was told ""your patient sounds like they enjoy their thoughts"" and I was denied, which made me a bit mad, but I hoped I could see someone else. I found a new GP and told him I wanted to see a therapist and that I had OCD, something I felt was obvious. He then tried to get me into the same OCD program that I had previously been denied, I considered it a bad idea, but worth a shot. I also mentally gave up on all my dreams for the future and wanted to focus on getting better, because it'd be worth it in the long shot (I don't know where such a thought came from, but it seems silly now). When I was accepted to see the OCD professionals I felt like I put my life and future in their hands. I got really hung up on it and though I didn't have a future anymore I was really excited to see what could happen with my mind. This stopped the themes completely. I had no idea what I went into, but I thought from what I had read that I had been accepted and all I had to tell them what I needed help with. They asked me what I had been thinking about the last week and I told them what I had been thinking about, but that I usually struggled with the two themes that I've written about. After the first session they told me they couldn't help me and I had been denied. Apparently they said that the intrusive thoughts I had seemed to bother me, but not cause anxiety. After that my anxiety levels went nuts, I couldn't really go an hour without shaking. I also worried I was physically ill and about to die soon. It was a time when my mental health really had an effect on my physical health. This continued until I got a new therapist by my GP and I was told that we had to see if I was allowed to get therapy (at this point I had been so many times to the doctor that therapy was free for the rest of the year). So when I started going there I felt like an audition and I had to prove how bad I was. I got constantly confused and I had no idea what I was in for. Maybe I needed reassurance that I had OCD, had I become well? (that's what the OCD professionals said, that I was cured).   


In December, I was told that I couldn't be helped and that I should get by on my own. Whenever I tell people this they are shocked, I don't know how normal this is or if it actually is for the best. I sometimes feel like all I want is a diagnosis and something to do to get better. I did get a diagnosis, I was told I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but I wasn't told what to do to get better. Again i feel like it's affecting my physical health. I started to get the shakes again and I just couldn't handle it. I almost went to the emergency room a few days ago, but I again felt like that was a bit too far and it would even ruin me more if they said ""this doesn't sound like an emergency"".

t2_13qgvmdg,"OK, This might be a little bit of a long story for you guys to read. So it all started right before i went to college where I was a virgin. I never had done anything with a girl sexually at that time. So right before going to college I guess you can say I was practicing kissing so I wouldn't be a disappointment. As I was practicing, an image of my brother popped in my head and immediately became obsessive about it. I did not want to be near him because of the distressing thoughts. However the thoughts felt pleasurable yet chaotic. After that, it felt like that the picture has changed. I began obssessing if i was attracted to woman (which I felt no longer attracted to them). I then felt attracted to men I was obsessing so much on what was going on. Now I will say that when I was high school I guess I was curious and had sexual urges for guys. By my freshman year in college I said to my self that i was gay and was in relief (I also said I was gay when i was in high school but was attracted to woman...I think lol).  Ive made a post on a website for lgbt for support and help. Ive seen pictures of people who were trans and never felt like them nor felt like I was trans. By going into my sophomore year in college, being a gay man caused me depression and caused me to be suicidal. So I kept on looking up on the websites if I had hocd ( meaning someone obsessing about being a homo). Then i came across an article of someone who was suffering from hocd, then had tocd. TOCD meaning Trans ocd. I then asked myself if I was Trans and got scared. It was almost like it was a relief for me to say it. Idk if it was because I was scared to say it and that my mind was playing tricks on me. Now I no longer feel like a man. Pronouns like he/him are tough to hear now. When I say I am a woman it feels like relief but at the same time it makes no sense. I hate it soo much. Ive read so much that sexuality and gender are both fluid but how can my gender change when I identified as a gay man and never in my life questioned my gender identity when i came up with an article about someone having hocd and then tocd. Ive had ocd symptoms my whole life. Ive had fears that felt pleasurable of wanting to kill my grandmother whenever I saw her along with cute little babies as well. There have been moments where I remember my buddies dad saying that I was staright and he knew that I was gay. Its a long story to tell but he said it like this ""I know he's straight"". In my head I was syaing that i was gay while I was having the trans thoughts. So idk if its OCD messing with my head or what. I get that people with ocd get anxiety when having the thoughts but this just has to be ocd. I remember when I was then struggling with my sexuality I never said I was a man because I never felt like ""man"" anymore. Meaning I started to feel more feminine, but then again could it be that I was obsessing so much about? So idk anymore. ",Is it possible that I have Transgender OCD? Please read,OCD,1,abvpt4,False

t2_2trtmjej,"This is kind of just a rant right now because I’m feeling overwhelmed and can’t concentrate at work. I [26F] woke up on New Years Day after hosting a party at my apartment and my immediate thought was that this was going to be my year of personal growth. For the last 3 ish years, I’ve kind of coasted over things I need to work on. Mainly self-love (I am really mean to myself), treating the people I am closest with better, continuing to grow in my career in a way that’s meaningful, etc. I spend most of my time worrying and not actually doing anything productive to help these things. I am in therapy and have been for 10 months but I don’t feel I’ve made any progress.

To clarify, I am in therapy for possible OCD (Pure O) and to deal with my catastrophic thinking.

We had friends (boyfriends friends) over all weekend and they are kind of judgey people. Usually I can find flaws with people with that kind of personality and tell myself they are just insecure and jealous, but these guys actually have great lives with a lot of success so it’s hurtful hearing them put other people down. I am always careful with what I say and how I act around them for fear of being called out - I can be a little awkward sometimes. On NYE we had other friends join us, some that I am more comfortable around. I was drunk and acting a little crazier/louder than usual and I remember the judgey friends not engaging so much and just sitting on the couch. I also could read their lips and see them making fun of my pit stains during a game we were playing (it was unbelievably hot in my apartment). Basically I woke up the next morning feeling extremely ashamed of my behavior and lack of perfection, and I pictured them talking badly about me on their long drive home. They are fun to be around and we do a lot together as two couples but at the same time I often leave the situation feeling defeated. 

Does any of this make sense? 

On top of this I’ve been having some ups and downs with my boyfriend so I don’t feel comfortable bringing this all up. We’ve been together for almost 6 years and everyone was asking when he’s going to propose and that they wish an engagement for me for 2019. It made me feel defeated again because we are not in the best place right now - I’ve become very insecure and it ends up getting lashed out on him. This also gets brought up in therapy.

I’m basically just going over the entire weekend and what I could’ve done and said differently and all the things that are wrong with me. I can’t tell if my goal is to care less what other people think or to just be better.

Tl;dr - Feel judged by boyfriends friends for being a little obnoxious on NYE, feeling like this in general and feeling pressured to be proposed to but boyfriend and I are having problems because I’m constantly worrying and insecure.

There’s a certain bush I don’t like walking by for bizarre ocd reasons and it was dark out. Anyway, I rushed out of my car and tried to get to where I felt safer as quickly as possible (which I know is avoidance and bad). The next morning I realized I left the car lights on and drained the battery. Immediately my mom starts yelling at me telling me how fear makes “people” careless, incompetent, and it causes harm to people around them. The reason I say “people” is because this obviously felt directed towards me and my condition. I just can’t really control getting afraid.

So I was really hurt by what my mom said and she does this thing where she pretends to go right back to normal like nothing ever happened and, I don’t know why, but it makes me so mad when she does that. So I kinda avoided her for the rest of the day because I was very hurt and uncomfortable and on the verge of tears around her. So I guess she realized I wasn’t really engaging with her when she spoke to me and she got so upset and said I was trying to hurt her, and her saying that literally broke me. It started to confirm all these thoughts in my mind that I’m an abusive person who manipulates people and I just wanted to shit out the world. 
I spoke to my sister and some friends because I literally thought it wasn’t normal for people to be upset with their parents and be a bit short with them.

I’ve been there, I get it. You just want answers and certainty and to feel safe again. It’s such a scary feeling. But you are not going to get well by getting momentary reassurance from strangers on the internet.

Anyway, I have severe OCD, Generailzed Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. The OCD is very much a social anxiety given when/what I Obsess about. The anxiety just amplifies it and then I fall into a depression.

I've noticed a trend in the last few years. Throughout high school, college, and my professional career in Teaching, I've noticed that my symptoms of OCD increase drastically when I'm on winter/spring/summer break from school (which is now work). Consequently, the rest of my issues (anxiety &amp; depression) are exacerbated. I'm in the pits of it right now. I had a stint in the winter of my first year of college when I nearly had to be hospitalized, and the only reason I didn't check myself in was because I knew I'd lose my scholarship and not graduate on time. It was horrible. And I feel pretty horrible right now. Thank heavens I go back to work on Monday. I was wondering if anyone else has had any similar experiences? Does your OCD get worse when you take a break from work or have extra free time on your hands? I try to stay busy to help, but there's only so much exercising, drawing, reading, Netflix one can consume before feeling lost again.

1. TP wipe (til it's at least 80-90% white)
2. Flushable wipe 
3. Pull pants up
4. Wash hands

Now, between 2 and 3...my OCD nags me and says ""you'll get your pants contaminated, waddle over to the sink, wash hands, THEN pull up"". 

Someone on reddit also once said that Fecal microbes can go through a 10-ply of TP (if such #-ply existed). So I imagine, using a thin wet wipe will surely ""contaminate"" my hands before having to pull pants up.

This has been happening for about a year now, maybe even more, I can't remember. I am usually doing something normal, going about my day, and then BAM I get hit with this VIVID feeling of guilt/regret about a particular thing I had done in my past. I then proceed to violently shake my head and my hands and try with all my might to not punch something.

t2_5ugomml,"Basically, I am pretty sure I have OCD and have had it since I was a child. I am now in my early 20s. 

I don't have an official diagnoses, never talked to a doctor (psychologist?) about it. Still trying to understand who I would talk to about it.

I am thinking of going to university at the end of this year, in the UK. 

I have come to realise that although it's not as bad as it was at its worst (when I was maybe 12-14), and although I have managed, I'd say, quite well with it, it does affect my life. At the worst times it affects how long it takes me to do certain tasks, and it means some tasks I put off doing or I avoid certain situations etc. 

Of course I know I have made it this far without extra help/allowances in school, but I definitely think just knowing my tutor knows I have OCD and I can talk to someone about it if it's ever especially difficult, would be really helpful. I will also of course try to manage the same as people without OCD, try to get to lectures on time and do essays on time, but I know at stressful points, I do struggle with stuff like that.

I have googled about letting University know I have OCD, and they seem very respecting of it in the UK and it seems a lot of Universities have resources to help with mental health etc., but it also seems like you have to prove you have OCD through your doctor/medical record or something like that.

I assume that means I'd have to get a diagnoses for it, and I am not sure I'm ready to get a diagnoses. I am not sure I want my family to know and I live at home right now so I'm worried I'd find it hard to keep them from knowing if I got a letter or such. 

I'm not embarrassed about it, but I don't feel it's their business and not sure they would understand.

I don't know if I come across as really stupid, I know it's probably good to go and talk to someone about it, and I am okay with that but I not sure if I am ready to have them write it on my medical records (partly as I don't yet know what it would involve and am new to researching).

For now, or until I'm ready, would I be able to let the University know about my OCD without them needing to confirm it professionally? Or would they not take it seriously without a professional saying ""yes, she has OCD""?

t2_31sfzlkm,"A few months ago I started going to therapy for the first time after a year long struggle with major anxiety and depression. Soon after starting to go to therapy, my therapist recommended going to a doctor to talk about antidepressants because my symptoms were so severe and had been going on so long. 

After about 4 therapy sessions she started to piece together my personality, anxieties, and habits and started to come to the conclusion that I may struggle with OCD. 

Now, several sessions later she is very confident the fundamental issue with my mental health struggles is OCD (or possibly a combination of OCD and OCPD.) 

When we came to this conclusion, logically, it made sense for me to feel a sense of clarity in having a more clear diagnosis knowing I can now get the proper treatment for what has been a lifelong battle for me. But shortly after this discussion, I went from a sense of clarity to a feeling of panic and fear that became completely overwhelming. The more I thought about it, researched it, or tried to process all of knew about it the more panicked I became at the realization that this is often a lifelong battle and isn't as easy to treat as anxiety/depression. 

Ever since that diagnosis, I feel trapped in my own head. This OCD has caused me so much pain and depression in the past and has made it very hard for me to fully enjoy life, I feel like I'm sentenced to a very depressing and anxiety ridden existence.

How have those of you who have felt like this learned to cope with it?

At first I wanted to come here and 'confess' something. Just to get peoples approval (reassurance). But that is not what I need. What I need is some help on how to deal with events that have or are happening where ocd latches itself onto. 

For example lately I've been getting alot of ocd about me being a new dad. But I'm mostly concerned about 'mistakes' I make. Which end up thinking I'm a bad father. Although some decisions made perfect sense to me at a time, if someone disagrees with me or even gets mad at me I'm unable to deal with that. I keep obsessing about what that person told me.

\*This was the worst one of them all ocd is here to stay now

\*this must mean something about me or else I would not keep feeling bad

While we were apart, I was struggling with the distance and family, and the fact that I was going to leave my family to return to England (his home /our home now) where we’ve lived together for almost a year. There were some days where he was unable to respond to my messages, and some days where his phone said he’d seen messages and not responded, while he responded to other threads we are both apart of. 

I felt so neglected and unimportant, and started questioning our relationship and whether I was a burden to him, whether I was negatively affecting his trip with family, and I withdrew, sending less messages, while simultaneously sending messages that I think were essentially asking for affirmations through a conversation. I came off as moody and unhappy, but was ineffective at expressing myself, and was also really just obsessing irrationally.

This is not the way I feel. I love him and living in England, and I feel very motivated and excited about all of the things I’ve been / will continue to be experiencing. So I tried to speak with him. 

He was (understandably) upset that I was reacting with doubt and uncertainty, but more so, he shared that it really bugs him that any time we fight, I seem to think it’s the end of us, the beginning of the end, or it’s a sign that it’s not meant to be. 

He’s from a household where his parents are together. I’ve seen them disagree or overheard arguments, and they always sort it out and move on.

Today my SO and I are going to see their heart doctor and I’m going to attempt talking to them about prescribing anti-anxiety medications. My SO is not diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but... his symptoms are honestly making life very difficult. It feel mean to say that but it’s the honest truth. He keeps having panic attacks so bad he thinks he’s having a heart attack which just makes it worse. It’s often difficult for me to leave the house because he’s so anxious about something happening to me. I need to send several updates and even then he isn’t fully calm until I’ve been home a while. He has so many triggers that he can’t even enjoy what used to be hobbies because small aspects of them (for instance he can’t read what used to be favorite books because of how many pages he has to skip to avoid triggers) send him into panic attacks. 

The problem is that he will 100% refuse therapy. I don’t want to share his personal history but a childhood therapist severely violated his trust. I’m pretty sure if his doctor insists on therapy my SO will start panicking right there. 

My SO has printed off an online questioners in which he scored 30/40 for OCD symptoms. Until he showed me I thought he was struggling with just anxiety and didn’t realize all the internal things that were affecting him. Obviously the print out isn’t a diagnosis but it said to show to a doctor. 

So my questions are;

1. Is is going to be weird if I bring this up? My SO suffers from selective mutism and likely won’t be able to talk about it. 

2. How can we refuse therapy without seeming like drug seekers. We’re not necessarily asking for Xanax. He’d actually prefer something to take everyday that prevented the attacks than something that stopped attacks from happening. 

3. Advice on how to talk to the doctor about what is happening without sounding like “boo hoo my life is hard even though they’re the one with the illness.”

I had a breakdown recently about it: it's left me bed-bound for days, I've told my parents everything and they're supportive and are helping me work through this. I realised, basically, that men go ugly and bald and I didn't want that. It was like an epiphany, I guess. I have severe OCD which gives me repetitive thoughts so I think this might be what's led this on. Thinking I was trans also coincided with a traumatic event in my life and I can now think of some reasons as to why this event made me want to feel ""genderless"" or no longer a woman as it related to men. I'm also straight, so it's not like I'm a GNC lesbian (which there is nothing wrong with, it's just not me). I never ever considered being trans until I was 20, despite the fact I knew and talked to trans people before and it never occurred to me. I know it's hypocritical; I respect trans people, but when I look back on asking people to use my new name, and visiting the FTM reddit I feel shamed and embarrassed about this. Sorry if this is a post which isn't allowed, I'm just desperate. I was just wondering, does anyone else here have a similar experience?

t2_21l8u8f5,"About six months ago, I decided to be more open with my anxiety issues. I've spent a significant amount of time trying to explain my issues with my family. To preface, I don't expect anyone who doesn't have ocd to understand my experience with it, I know that's unfair. I've been trying to be patient and understanding, and I'm aware that they may be trying their best to understand. Its just incredibly frustrating to have everyone around you misunderstand your intentions and behavior. My father is a man of principle and personal responsibility. Obviously, him encouraging me to have these values is fine on its own. My issue is that he's constantly conflating my ocd with excuses and ""bad habits"". I've been trying to get through to him, but he continues to tell me that he doesn't think I'm making a sincere effort. Its extremely irritating to get the same lecture about things I already understand. Over the past few months, my anxietty has been  becoming increasingly difficult to handle and it has led to me missing or being late to events in our family's religious community. This has upset him, and I keep on trying to tell him I'm trying but he seemingly ignores me. I try to reason with him by asking why I wasn't having these issues at a couple of years ago (when my ocd wasn't as intense) but suddenly i am. He seems to think I've suddenly become incredibly irresponsible and lazy. I just don't know what to do. My brothers also do these things and its irritating. I don't have as much as an issue with it since I haven't been as transparent with them but its still difficult to handle. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm so tired of this shit.

t2_34rwrhsi,"Around this time last year I went through a very bad POCD cycle. I had experienced other themes of OCD in the past but nothing as bad as POCD. I slowly overcame it over the last year, but still get spikes from it every now and then. But recently, I relapsed due to remembering something that I did a few years ago. I believe I was 16. (I am 20 now.) I saw a news story on a pedophile. After seeing that, I was disgusted by him and the things he did, and I wondered what could possibly go through a person like that’s mind. Why are they attracted to kids? I couldn’t understand why a person would see a kid in a sexual way. Although it made me wonder if it were possible for me to ever be one, and that thought terrified me. So one night, and this is very hard for me to even talk about, I decided to try to fantasize about one. I do not remember liking it. I thought it was gross and I still didn’t (and still don’t) understand why someone would be attracted to a kid. After that, I simply thought it was weird and felt a little gross for thinking about it, and moved on. Also, around this same time, not long after seeing that news story and still obsessing over it and wondering if I could be one, I did something else that I am disgusted with myself for. I attempted to find loli on Tumblr. Thankfully I didn’t find any, I felt gross and quickly exited the page and never tried to find that again. But I am still disgusted at myself for ever trying to find it. I thought it would be a way for me to test myself without seeing anything real, however now I know that even if no real kids were harmed, it’s still absolutely deplorable and harms kids in other ways.

I did not know about POCD at the time, but looking back, I suppose this was a form of POCD. I saw a news story, worried I could be one, and tried testing myself to prove to myself I was not one.

I am not worried that I am a pedophile. I know that I am not. I am around kids quite often and I am fine around them. I have no attraction towards them and I don’t even really get intrusive thoughts (although it’s happened before, it’s easy for me to dismiss intrusive thoughts as I know that is all they are.) I think pedophilia is absolutely disgusting and I in no way support it. My worry is that I have done pedophilic things in the past and now I am no better than them. I feel like a hypocrite for saying things against it and even for being supportive of people I have known who have been victims of it. This has made it hard for me to function. I don’t know what to do. I feel so disgusted with myself and I feel like I don’t deserve the great life that I have. I feel like I have a horrible secret that would make everyone I know hate me and possibly even get me arrested if it were found out. I can’t keep living with this feeling.

t2_b5agb,"I've had OCD since I was old enough to form coherent thoughts. Although some of my compulsions are physical, most are distinctly mental. I have severe hangups with repetitive thoughts, punctuality, time management, orderliness, and plans. Changes are extraordinarily harsh on me unless I have planned for them.

I've been married for three years. Sometimes it's very difficult because my wife is relatively easy-going and expects similar things from me at times. She seems to ""understand it's hard on me"", but because she doesn't have this debilitation, she often makes choices that send me into spirals. She's just trying to live a normal life. I'm simply unable to do so quite so easily.

Tonight, for example, we had planned to have pasta for dinner and watch some of the final episodes of Breaking Bad that we've been watching for the last few weeks. About two hours before she got off work, she texted me to say she was inviting her friend over instead. This change caused an instant spiral for me. The plans I'd had in my head for days now suddenly got turned upside down. Not only did the plans change, but I would now have a stranger I haven't even met before coming into my comfort zone and forcing me into socialization I hadn't wanted or had adequate time to adjust my brain to.

For my wife, she clearly views this as an inconvenience for me that I'll just need to deal with. For me, it's completely ruined my entire night and set me into a mentally destructive headspace of discomfort and irritability. With adequate time to plan ahead for it, I'd have felt mildly uncomfortable with the scenario but remained pleasant. Instead, it was thrown on me last second. 

These types of situations really make marriage hard for those of us with OCD. My wife's tendency for messiness would mildly annoy someone else. It makes me physically uncomfortable and mentally unwell to see her clothes thrown all around the room every day. It makes my living space significantly less comforting. ""Let's stay around the house this weekend"" means exactly that to me. A sudden blaze of energy from her on a Sunday afternoon to go out and do things completely unexpectedly sends me into a totally unhealthy mental zone. She doesn't see all the intricate, endless details I work out in my brain based around my expectations for a day. She doesn't go through my checklist of things I allow or disallow myself to do to ensure I'm properly prepared for specific outcomes and situations. She doesn't think about how I debated on having a cup of coffee (I have IBS too) and decided to under the expectation that ""we aren't going anywhere"" means ""we aren't going anywhere"". Then suddenly we are going somewhere, and now I have a nervous stomach and spend the day uncomfortable both mentally and physically trying to navigate myself through the hours until I can feel comfortable again.

These little things begin to add up. And I sometimes squeeze by and it doesn't affect me as much as other times. Sometimes I have good days and get through these situations with nary a problem. But some days it's so downright debilitating I end up wanting to just stay in bed and avoid ever having to plan anything or be expected to live up to any expectations.

I love my wife. I love being married. I WANT to be married. But damn if it isn't difficult to have someone else think of your OCD as you being ""minorly inconvenienced"" while you're losing your shit inside all the time. I feel like I'm always losing. Either I upset her by demanding for things to remain as planned in life and subsequently hear how awful that makes me, or I do my best to adjust while living every day in fear of what's next to throw off my rituals or expectations.

As far as I understand, most people with contamination OCD have a specific fear like “I’ll get sick and die if I touch this contaminated thing.”    I do not have a “root cause fear” that I can identify.  I know I won’t get sick if I touch something that’s contaminated.   Today as part of my ERP I touched a water cooler at work that I feel is “contaminated,” then proceeded to eat lunch with my hands.   It wasn’t pleasant but honestly I didn’t feel much stress while eating because I knew the germs would not hurt me.   However, I still felt obsessed with the idea that my hands were contaminated and still felt a need to wash my hands after eating because I didn’t want to “contaminate” other objects in my office.   

I thought ERP is supposed to work like this - you expose yourself to the thing you are obsessed about, see that the thing you were afraid of doesn’t happen, then you eventually feel better because the fear did not materialize.     But in my case I don’t think I have an underlying fear - I know the germs won’t hurt me or kill me or whatever but still obsess over the dirt.

t2_11ahtf,"Hello r/OCD,

I had a recent experience that might be considered a “checking” experience, and I was hoping to see if anyone could relate or tell me if this is part of their OCD (I’m not asking whether I have OCD, though)

Background: I work at a lab at my college. Our PI sent out a schedule last week with all our shifts listed. He said the lab would be starting stuff soon, but not until he said it would.

The most senior undergraduate in our lab repeated this. Still, according to the schedule, I had a shift at 8:30 on Wednesday, and even though I was told TWICE (once after I asked if shifts started) that shifts didn’t start this week, I was still worrying about missing a shift on Wednesday.

So I went to the lab at 8:25 this Wednesday (he told us to be there five minutes early). Of course, nobody’s there - there were two other people scheduled to be with me this shift.

But what if they’re both just late? I check again at 8:30. Still, nobody there.

And yet, I STILL think that I’m making a mistake. One of the people who was supposed to be there was in one of my classes afterwards. So after that, I have to ask her. She says that since the PI hadn’t sent an email saying the lab was starting - like he said he would - that she didn’t go. I almost gave her a scare, because she thought when I asked that that she had missed her shift (and I still feel pretty bad about that).

And of course, yesterday, the PI sent an email saying the lab was starting next week.

So, would this fall under “checking”? I have a therapist for my anxiety, and when I told them about this, they said they would bring diagnostic criteria to see if I had OCD even though they weren’t sure if it was. I was just wondering if you guys can relate to this, I’m not asking for a diagnosis.

And also maybe I /we could really get killed because of these guys(with who we have in the white house,yeah..)..I guess it's the fact they could end up killing my(and others) ass that they scare me so fucking much..the reason why they piss me off so fucking much.

And then our fucking media and politicians think they're practically an existential threat to the fucking world,no,**THE WHOLE FUCKING HUMAN RACE!!**

And..when I try to say that everyone who tried to tell me it's gonna be ok...my mind just screams ""LIES"" and then the anger/despair comes.

And what's even worse is that there's a disconnect between people in the media,politicians and other people elsewhere between whether or not NK is threat,whether or not we will have war with NK,and whether or not they will fuck us all over single-handedly.

My mind is trying to make heads or tails of it all..and failing miserably.

I've wanted to go to Japan since I was a little kid,and now because of these chucklefucks,I don't fucking know anymore..or maybe I just have to accept that they WILL kill me and go anyway.

It can not touch the wall of the shower when I put it on the shower shelf unless it’s been cleaned recently (the wall) When I wanna wash certain parts of my body I have to put the soap and shampoo behind the shower curtain or otherwise I feel like my filth will touch it and somehow get inside it.

For the past few years I've had terrible anxiety stemming from paranoia and obsession for the safety of my loved ones and myself. I'm scared to see a psychiatrist because when I went about 4 years ago, they didn't take me seriously and kind of blew me off and it literally caused me to have a panic attack leaving the office. Here's some stuff that I do that I think might mean I have it and if anyone who does actually have it can let me know if it's just normal stuff, behavior that they've experienced, or if I'm just rlly weird that'd be great. I'm not looking for anyone to diagnose me I'm genuinely just curious and would like some validation for what I'm feeling because I do know it's not normal or at least I feel like its not.

1. When I was pregnant (it was at the time when Donald Trump and Kim Jong un were having that dumb twitter war) I was so convinced we would get hit by an EMP or we would go into a nuclear war that I would check the news online every morning when I woke up and every night before I went to bed. I obsessively googled how to prepare for a nuclear attack, what to do when a bomb hits, how high are the possibilities that we'll go into war soon, how to protect yourself from radiation and things like that. I would think about what I would do with my baby if that happened and basically saw visions in my head of it going down and different scenarios playing out over and over where I'd be hiding or fleeing with my daughter in my arms.

2. When I have the strong urge to self harm I see myself doing it in my head in much more violent ways than I'd actually do it in real life and sometimes I feel like the images will never stop

3. When I send long messages especially when it's a heated discussion or me expressing some way I feel, I'll read them over and over and over again and i honestly dont know why. (I'll probably do it with this post.)

4. I have a tracking app on my phone for my roommates, my mom, and my daughter's father. If my roommates take my daughter out I watch them on the tracking app the whole time and imagine all these different illogical scenarios where my daughter could somehow end up in harm's way even though I trust them completely. One time her dad had her and his phone died so I couldnt watch him on the app or call him and his mom couldn't get ahold of him and it caused me to have a panic attack 

5. Sometimes when my anxiety is really bad I feel like I want to jump out of my skin and I see images in my head of me just going insane and hitting everyone and everything around me, ripping my hair out and pulling at my skin 

6. I look for exits everywhere I go. My worst fear is being in the middle of a mass shooting and I'm not quite sure if that's logical or not

7. I dont trust airplanes, busses, can't imagine ever going on a cruise for fear of the ship sinking or pirates (someone told me thats a thing and now I dont think I ever will) or falling off the edge, won't go swimming in the ocean because of sharks and I barely can contain my anxiety when someone is driving a tiny bit over the speed limit

I'm sure there's more stuff I'm forgetting and you guys can tell me if maybe I'm just extremely paranoid and a little obsessive and it's not actually a condition or anything I need to possibly get medicated for or find coping mechanisms cause I honestly wouldn't know where to start.

t2_u64gi,"Hi everyone. I'm going through a really tough time and I would really appreciate any insight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the Christmas break, I was at my parent's house and I had these weird intrusive thoughts.

I had something like that before, but never as bad as this. 

&amp;#x200B;

But since then it's absolutely spiraled out of control. It feels like I'm obsessed with my dad, and I don't even know why anymore. I think it's because when the thoughts started I dealt with them in a very bad way. At the point, I should have immediately said to myself, these are just thoughts, you don't really want to do this, etc. But those thoughts are one thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I have now are two things. The first being a fear of thinking of my dad. In other words, I lay on a bed and I suddenly think that he gave me that bed, and then it all spirals. It's so frustrating. This is so powerful. When it starts it fucking crushes me, and it happens again and again and I just don't know what anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing is this strange thing that doesn't make any fucking sense but happens anyway. Something in my mind says: what if I associate this with my dad? Now, this doesn't make any real sense, but it happens. And the problem is that this gives me anxiety and then the next time I do that, or rather realize that, it gives me anxiety. Crazy things that aren't real. The thing with this is that it doesn't even exist. I've tried to explain this to myself. it doesn't make any fucking sense. It's like what if I associate the chorus of songs with my dad? and then I'm listening to a song and I remember and I get anxiety even though there is nothing. I mean what the hell ever is associating? It makes zero sense.  Also, this can be with real things and things that don't exist. Like for example a word, or a concept or a thought or whatever. Liking thinking of the future, it sounds crazy but it happens and I just don't know why or what the hell this is all about, but it's like oh I'm thinking of the future and I had a moment like I described above before with it so it's all bad now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with all of this is that what the exact DAD in this whole anxiety is is rather strange to me. Because it's like it's not even my real dad. There is no reality in it. It's all just blurry memories making me anxious, but there is no real thinking about my dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds crazy and shit and less than two months ago I would have thought the same, but in this current mental state, it's all so real and painful. And I have to wait for ages for help.

I’m struggling badly today and while this is probably reassurance, I really need some help to get through. Over a year ago, at a work event, I got close to a girl while she was showing me something (don’t exactly remember) I liked that our arms touched and I purposely kept my arm there for a while, perhaps even leaned in more. I felt guilty and told my wife (although I can’t remember if I told her that I may have even leaned in to make the touch stronger). I then wanted to go to work events (beer Fridays) but felt like it could be to flirt or touch the girl in the same manner. I struggled mentally, prayed asked for forgiveness and moved on. Sometimes I went sometimes I didn’t, sometimes I wondered if she would be there.

I now want to tell my wife that I felt these things when I wanted to go to beer Fridays after the first incident of touching this girl. 

Should I? or am I making this a big deal to me only? I’ve tried to talk to her but she is says she doesn’t want to hear it and is quick to shut down any OCD engagement.

t2_348l7o8j,"Hi all,

I just want to rant about something that I noticed most of us doing. We’re putting too much power into the OCD that we experience.

First off, choosing words to describe ourselves goes a long way. It’s not OUR ocd, it’s THE ocd that comes in waves. It’s not OUR thoughts tricking us, it’s OBSESSIVE thoughts tricking us. 

Don’t make yourself one with the effects OCD. We need to weaken the bond we have with it to be able to see that much clearer when it comes to dissociating with intrusive thoughts.

This is by no means the cure, because we all know that everyone gets intrusive thoughts, and our bodies and minds react to the thoughts more-so than other people. BUT. I want us all to stop bowing down to “OCD” and give it the power to control us and define us.

Yeah, I watch horror movies and obsessively panic for days tha I might one day snap and hurt people. I have sex once in a while and spiral into believing that I have HIV, even though I took tests to prove I don’t have it. 

But that does not make me less than people who are able to let go of these thoughts that come into their minds. I’m not less than the people who don’t understand me.

It’s sad I put the OCD on a pedestal and let it make me feel bad about myself. Yes, it sucks that sometimes my thoughts can be debilitating, but the one thought that needs to be louder than the rest should be: “Thank you, but that’s not me. I know who I am. Next,”

But now an exhausting compulsion to re read constantly is threatening to take away something I really hold dear and want to keep as a lifetime hobby. I’ve been trying to push myself through it, and I can actually start out quite promising. After a few stop starts, especially with chapter titles, I can be fine for a few pages. If the chapter is longer, however, there’s a really noticeable decline in my ability to read fluently without stopping. It just gets worse the longer I do it. I hate this and just want to get rid of it and reclaim my passion. Is there anything I can try that could help me? I understand my compulsion is nowhere near as bad as many people on here have it, but it still affects the quality of my day to day life and I fear that my compulsions can manifest stronger if I leave things unchecked.

And in the end… *Wouldn’t I just be paying someone to feed into my delusions?* 

No one wants to think of themselves as a bad person. No one *really* wants to be the villain of the story, right? So, who am I to say that my intrusive thoughts are actually intrusive and that I’m not just neck deep in denial about my true nature?

The reason I'm curious is I relate to the PATTERN of highs and lows with bipolar, but I don't experience the extreme bouts of energy vs manic episodes. I just simply am on a rollercoaster of doing just fine, being on top of my work/thoughts and then suddenly, BOOM: Oh no I'm bipolar, (or have cancer, or AIDS, or might harm people in the future, whatever the trigger is), and that lasts a few days to 2 weeks....then I get my life together and I'm productive and happy for another 2 weeks.

t2_2a2znpmd,"Hi everyone,

I’ve struggled with ocd for quite a while now. I talked to a over the phone counselor who believes that I have it - I’ve also talked to a psychiatrist who believes my symptoms are a result of generalized anxiety along with the way I was raised (very religious/strict). I’ve come to the conclusion that it is in fact OCD, because looking back, I realize I’ve had it most of my life.


Anyways, the theme that has been the worst so far is POCD. And it gets better and worse, but today it’s just awful. Sometimes it’s really bad in the mornings for some reason. I had some weird dream last night that involved 12-13 year old girls nipples. I woke up and I’m like, this is stupid, whatever. But then I got thoughts about my bf’s 5-year old daughters nipples and I felt like I was aroused. I’m also used to the groinal response, so nothing new. 


But it got to the point where I was laying in bed all morning and I kept feeling the arousal and seeing that image in my head and it felt like I didn’t even care and didn’t try to hard to fight it. That’s what’s freaking me out. Because then I had this thought/feeling along the lines of “you can think of her like that anytime/this is okay” and then I thought to myself what if my bf knew what was going on in my head?? And the feeling of panic and dread washed over me. And it almost “brought me back to earth” type of a feeling, like making me realize how fucked up all of that was, whereas I was like numb to it for the previous several minutes or however long it was.


I’ve been getting eaten up with guilt, why didn’t I try harder to stop the arousal/thoughts? Why did it take thinking about my boyfriend to get the numbness to go somewhat away? I feel so incredibly guilty and sad and anxious and afraid.",Please help. I feel like I’m drowning,OCD,1,amj65z,False

I noticed that I don't really remember if I zipped my pockets with gloves, my bag with clothes and documents, or which bus I took (what if I mistook).

Anyway, I have an obsession with bed bugs. The last 3-4 months, I’ve been itchy and keep finding bumps/rashes. I know it could be anything, I have extremely sensitive skin, but I cannot relax. I’m obsessed with looking things up about bed bugs. I’ve probably read every article about them on the internet. I look things up when I wake up, while I’m at work, laying in bed, at the bar, literally 85% of my day is me looking up bed bugs. Comparing my red marks and reading stories from other people and projecting my life onto it. 

I check the bed all of the time. I live at my bfs apartment and it’s a little messy which drives me insane but that’s a different story for a different time. The mattress has stains on it from who knows what, that have been there since I moved in, but I automatically assume it’s bed bugs. I have a hard time sleeping at night because I feel things crawling on me. I stay up until 2,3,4,5 am, every couple minutes shining the flashlight under the covers to look for them. Constantly checking the sheets and freaking out over pieces of black fucking lint. 

I truly believe my life will be ruined if we have bed bugs. My bf is so messy, I don’t think he would keep his stuff in bags and reduce clutter and do things you’re supposed to do when you have bed bugs. I don’t think we would ever get rid of them. Then we would go to move to a new place and we would just take them with us. I feel like this is going to be the rest of my life. I’ll never not be itchy. I’ll never sleep in a bug free bed. I want to have an exterminator come in but I brought it up to my bf so many times that it started an argument so I’m afraid to bring it back up. He doesn’t know how badly I’ve been obsessing over it because I’ve been hiding it, and I’m not sure how to talk to him about it. 

I have fears of other bugs that could be causing the itching too. Lice is right up there with bed bugs. My bf keeps itching his head and every time he does I silently freak out because I assume it’s lice. Then my head gets itchy and I feel things crawling. I’ve checked his head multiple times and haven’t found anything, it’s probably just dry skin, but in my head, it’s always the worst.

t2_2gx36ker,"I know you can’t officially diagnose me. I never thought I could have ocd because I didn’t do things that I believed were associated with ocd. I never had to double check that I locked the door, or flip the light switch 6 times before it was “ok”. 

I’ve had anxiety and mild depression my whole life.
However the symptoms of pure o strike me as very similar to things I’ve suffered with.

There is always something that I’m ruminating over. Like 90% of my time is spent ruminating over something. I will have themes that last few months or years and intrusive thoughts that attack as well as easily being triggered by anything relating to them. When this happens I constantly feel the need to reassure myself that I’ll be ok.

It started with religion. I was terrified of going to hell and obsessed with finding out which religion was “the real one” and whether I was “saved” or not. I must have asked Jesus to save me a thousand times. Nights spent crying and worrying over it. Talking to about a dozen pastors and seminary students looking for 100% proof that I had picked the right religion. Eventually ironically I became agnostic and gave that fear up but I think it’s because it was just replaced my a new fear:

My fear of being anything but heterosexual. It took months to years of constant worry that I’d never figure out what I was. Did I like guys or girls more? I constantly tested my attracted towards both genders trying to figure out my feelings. Eventually I discovered that I was bisexual and let that fear go. 

Of course I replaced it with other fears. Intrusive thoughts of losing my job that plague me still. I was fired once and I actually believe that was a catalyst for my mental health going from mildly bad to danger! I never really was the same person after that. I constantly get triggered by even small facial mannerisms my boss will make. Or worry and plan how I will be ok when I get fired: It’s exhausting. And ironically it negatively impacts my job.

Other minor fears have been worrying I’ll accidentally cut my boob off or rip a hang nail off too far and these feelings actually make me cringe.

t2_13dy98si,"So ever since about a year and a half ago I’ve been having problems with my speech. I seem to focus on my mouth and tongue movements when talking and try too hard to control them. The best way I can describe it is that I’m speaking more manually than automatically, similar if you had to focus on breathing. It seems like almost a hyper awareness issue. I was born with OCD and Generalized anxiety but throughout the years and through therapy and medication as a kid I’ve been able to control it almost all my life till now. I sometimes even forgot I had OCD. While no one has been able to really tell a difference in my speech, I have and it feels almost sloppy and like I don’t trust myself to get the words out. Kind of like learning to walk for the first time. I’ve always had a little social anxiety but I’ve kind of learned to get over that and have become a lot more social. That being said I’m not really sure why this has been an issue. I used to smoke marijuana back in high school and my first year of college but I would start to get anxiety attacks while high. Also while I was high I would be very self conscious by the way I sounded speaking so I think there’s a strong chance that smoking weed had something to do with it. However, I’ve recently changed who I am as a person and stopped some of my bad habits. I didn’t open up about this with my parents until over the summer and began seeing a therapist. His advise for me was just to just talk more often that way I would get comfortable speaking again. I’ve gone to him about five times and his advise has always been the same. He seems pretty confident in his approach and when he explains it it makes sense, however I’ve haven’t noticed really any change in my speaking. I don’t think he’s trying to get money out of me since he’s offered to follow up with me for free on the phone. About 4 or 5 weeks ago I started a 20mg daily dose of Prozac to see if that would improve my conditions, so far I haven’t noticed any changes really. This is the first time I’ve been on medication and saw a therapist in probably 12 or so years. Some days are good and my speech feels more fluent and flows naturally and some days I feel like I sound drunk. I notice usually when I’m talking to new people or reading out loud my speech is ok probably because I’m more focused on the conversation or the reading than being self aware about how I’m talking. I don’t really know where to go from here and I’m feeling a little hopeless, I don’t know if I should try looking for a new therapist or even maybe a speech therapist. I’m also thinking about upping my dosage of the anti-depressant I’m on. It weird because I don’t really feel self-conscious but I obviously am or I wouldn’t be having this issue. I can’t really tell if it’s my OCD or something else either, my psychologist thinks it is though. I’m just curious of anyone else on here has had a same issue or a psychologist who has dealt with something like this in the past. I will take any advise though!

After addressing my ADHD, my doctor and I decided it’s time to move forward with OCD treatment because I couldn’t enjoy the simple things in life anymore, and started to believe I caused a friend’s cancer and other shitty things, so when he said any SSRI will help me find joy in small things, I was hopeful. He also said I might not feel a difference in the first week.

I took my first pill expecting to feel 0 effect for a few days, but I actually felt a drop in bad thoughts and anxiety within a few hours. I actually slept for the first time in my life without performing a made up prayer to protect my family. Eventually I found joy in watching my dog  be silly, and color with my niece and nephew. 

My doctor decided it’s time to increase the dosage to 20mg instead of 10 when I mentioned a sudden drop in confidence from the night before for no reason. I couldn’t get any work done and it took me 5 hours to get started. Luckily, I work from home for an awesome company that wants me to be well and take care of my health. We also decided that I’d take it at night instead of morning because my eyes were puffy and I felt sleepy throughout the day.

I’ve been on 20 mg for 2 days now; first day, I slept for 3 hours and had reasonable energy(as if I had started my day after a good night’s sleep), today, I actually ended up missing work because my eyes were puffy and I had a migraine. I called my doctor and he said to stop taking Paxil. I have to fly to Canada for a work trip on Sunday, and really don’t want to risk withdrawals then :( 

My doctor said we can bring it down to 10 mg until he sees me again after my trip. It felt like I had to remind him I might go through withdrawals.

And while some individuals end up speaking in front of crowds or taking a sense of pride and ownership, others prefer to live life without letting others know. It isn’t a sexy thing as it appears on TV. It infiltrates every moment of the day. 

I like to help people, to be next to them when they need that little bit of extra support to achieve their goals. I refuse to ask for help from others. I am an independent person and have had to rely on myself for everything since the age of 16. For a person who has worked so hard for nearly two decades to be self-sufficient, having to come to someone who is in a position of power over you, someone you respect, and say “there is something that everyone else can do, but I cannot do” is devastating.

Imagine yourself in this situation: you have a brain that is brilliant. But inside that brilliant head is a defect. Some of the neurons got hooked up wrong, and so the very nature of how you experience thinking is different from other people. No matter how smart you are, or disciplined, you cannot think your way out of some things. You cannot turn off the defective thoughts. You feel weak.

You frequently wake up at 2 AM and cannot fall back asleep because of a thought stuck in your head. That thought could be something small, or it could be about every personal failing you have ever had, in crystal clear high-definition.

You get everywhere an hour early because being a minute late is taboo. You take a picture of the iron so you can be sure you didn’t accidentally burn the house down. You feel contaminated every time you shake someone’s hand, or take a piece of paper from them. It feels like you have been exposed to a biohazard site, and you have to go wash your hands, possibly twice or three times. On busy days, this means your hands crack and burn and bleed from so much sanitizer.

You re-read every email you write 5 times to be sure there are no typos, every report you create to be sure everything is perfect. You log in to work at 5 AM and compulsively refresh email every 3 minutes all day long. 

You turn in good work, on time or early. If you mess up, maybe your status will no longer be safe. Maybe everything will fall apart. The people you work with and consider friends will no longer want to know you. You will get fired.

My therapist has been cautious to avoid diagnosis but I felt that my concerns may best fit this sub as it falls under what he describes as my recurrent “obsessive and compulsive behavior”.  Please let me know if I’ve posted to this sub in error.

I have a big issue with magical thinking. I am also a severely fearful flier, though I fly just about every month. Every flight is a battle for me usually fought with copious amounts of wine, but an upcoming solo trip from Doha to Tbilisi has me faring worse than usual. I always find that in the week or so leading up to a flight, my mental health takes a sharp decline and it becomes harder to reason with myself. I’ve had to really face this fear over the last year when my partner and I moved 7000 miles from home. I’m glad, in a way, that I am in a position now where I am forced to travel often or I’d probably never set foot on a plane again.

Anyways, my dilemma here. Lately I feel as though I am seeing “signs” of an imminent plane crash. These signs include: seeing 9:11 on my watch every day when I check the morning time, hearing about the plane crash in Houston as well as the two plane issues with landing and takeoff at London gatwick recently, constantly getting notifications from r/catastrophicfailure of plane crash videos and no other reddit notifications, and this morning I was reading a book to my partner and it started talking about plane hijackers. 

So, yes I know... logically... that these events are in no way connected to my upcoming flights. But I can’t help but pander to that stupid little voice that goes “what if?!” .. it’s awful. I reached out to a friend who is afraid of flying and told her everything, and she made things worse by saying “really you shouldn’t go on the flight, my dog just got hit by a car and I saw signs before.” She is, like me, overly superstitious and honestly I shouldn’t have even discussed my concerns with her but it made my feelings a thousand times worse. 

I find myself calling to my friends and therapist looking for reassurance that my plane won’t crash, which of course is not something that they could ever know. I seem to be unable to accept that I don’t have the answers, and it results in me becoming positive that the worst thing imaginable will happen and that the universe is letting me know.

t2_2krqhg8d,"TRIGGER WARNING POCD AND ABUSE 

I am a 20 year old woman with diagnosed OCD. Life has been incredibly stressful recently and my POCD has come back. It’s the most convincing it’s ever been and I am disgusted with myself and convinced that I am going to burn in Hell.

I was sitting on the sofa, anxious about university when the thoughts came in that I was a pervert. I’ve managed to convince myself before that it’s POCD and not actual pedophilia but this time my Brian was saying - just because you’re not into actual children doesn’t mean you’re not into 14 year olds (I find this idea repulsive) 

My ocd has a tendency to attach to things that seem ‘real’ - memories and experiences and this makes it all the more crippling because I feel like these moments become truth.

Most of my private fantasies are about much much older men and women and this is okay but this isn’t always the case

Basically i have recurring sexual fantasies that take place in my old high school with my old high school bullies and usually have fantasies about being sexually abused by a whole cast of people I used to know in high school. Abuse is a common sexual theme for me. I have had these fantasies since I was 14 myself and have never really considered them wrong because I figured I was fantasising about those individuals as they are now (ie. always the same age as me - 20) and not as actual 14 hear olds. In the fantasies I am never older than them - we are always the same age. 

Sometimes when I have these fantasies I feel disgusted with myself because the thought of sexually touching someone underage physically repulses me is and then quickly dismiss it because I would decide that no one was underage. in my fantasy everyone has aged the same as I have and we are all 20. I wouldn’t even worry about it and think that the fantasy is more based on the power dynamic than the age

But now I am consumed by shame and suicidal thoughts. 

Why do I still have the same fantasies I did when I was 14? Is it because I am becoming a pedophile? Am I evil? Am I imagining myself as a 14 year old ? Is it normal for fantasies to take place in high school? 

 I’m terrified and physically repulsed to the point that I want to be sick that because my fantasies take place in a school with people I only knew in school that means I am actually interested in 14 year olds and am a pervert and a pedophile.

I have never as an adult woman looked at someone underage and been attracted to them. I am repulsed by the idea of doing anything with someone underage but I am scared I am actually just a repressed pedophile making up excuses. I am in a loving healthy relationship with a man my age who I am deeply attracted to and every time he tries to so much as touch me at the moment I feel repulsed because I am convinced he doesn’t know that I’m a monster. 

Apologies for the long post and for the disgusting things you have just read. I’m terrified. I haven’t been able to eat in 2 days and I feel genuinely dead inside. I’d kill myself if I wasn’t so scared of going to hell.

t2_23igf07r,"Hi all, I'm not really sure what the point of writing this is going to be but I'm starting to slip really badly into the crooks of OCD after it not really being an issue for years.
When I was about 10, I was initially diagnosed with OCD after my parents took me to see a doctor, who then referred me to a children's councillor. The reason my parents referred me was that I was having intrusive thoughts re: my Gran dying if I didn't act on a compulsion, such as the usual light switch flicking, tapping walls a certain amount times, having to step into entrances with a particular foot etc. They weren't majorly impacting on me at that age because it wasn't really something I saw as 'different,' but the thoughts would scare me to the point where I would stay awake at night acting on compulsions 'just in case.' It got to breaking point when I stopped eating because I was convinced that food was contaminated and at one point I managed to convince myself that items that people gave to me would either blow up or contamination would seep into my skin, which might not make sense but it was really scary at that age.
Anyway, I had CBT and I eventually seemed to just sort of... forget about it? I don't really remember what happened but it seemed to resolve itself. 
Around 15 I started self-harming, but it had to be a certain amount of times before I stopped otherwise my parents would die. The number of cuts increased until I got to 60, at which point I was re-referred to the adolescent team and was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression. At that point, I started taking anti-depressants (initially Fluoxetine) but again, it seemed to calm itself down.
Until recently, I found that I'd only get intrusive thoughts if I was really worried or anxious about something, and even then it was more pure compulsions than concerning thoughts, like touching something a certain  amount of times until it 'felt right' - I don't know if that makes any sense? 
I've been through a lot of personal trauma over the last 5 years (24 now) but recently over the last month or so I've noticed the thoughts come back to the point where they're impacting on my life severely. I'm in a relationship with a lovely guy and my thoughts at the moment are 'If you don't do (certain compulsion) then he will cheat on you.' He's away at the moment with a group of friends and one of them is someone he hooked up with a long time ago, and even though he's never given me the slightest reason that anything would happen, I'm absolutely terrified that it'll happen. He's a really lovely loyal guy and I feel like I'm going to drive him away by being so paranoid about it all because it's constantly on my mind.
To go into detail with my compulsions at present, I have to unbolt my door 4 times, lock the door, check the handle 6 times with my left foot on the doormat and right foot on a specific tile, then walk up my stairs touching certain parts of the walls and banister, flick the switch at the top of the landing 4 times, get into bed by only walking 4 steps, and when I get into bed and start to settle (I struggle to sleep as it is) I HAVE to make myself get up and do it all again. This can happen 15+ times and is really ruining my quality of sleep. Last week the doctor prescribed me a short course of sleeping tablets because I was absolutely exhausted and was starting to get really tearful. I didn't mention the OCD thoughts and just said I had a lot on at work at the moment because I just don't know what to say, what will happen and how to cope with it. I'm getting so upset about it because I can't see a way out of this at the moment. Does anyone have any advice of any kind?

t2_10u09l,"Hey! I originally created this post for [r/CompulsiveSkinPicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompulsiveSkinPicking) but have noticed a lot of people here asking about their skin picking and looking for help so I wanted to share it with you all. CSP, or compulsive skin picking, was also recently recognized by the DSM-V (that big book of medical diagnoses!), so a lot of research is finally beginning to be done on it.

As someone who has struggled intensely with CSP (compulsive skin picking) for the past 8 years, to the point where it's affected my daily life, the biggest thing that's helped me is learning about the neurological basis for the disorder, and accordingly, how to work on healing.

CSP has neurological ties to OCD &amp; BDDs which means that the habitual aspects can be broken like many other habits, and the self-perception issues can be attacked like many other mental problems - essentially:

***Tips for people with OCD or a BDD can be modified for CSP !!***

\*\*this is important because there's so little help for CSP currently - which can be so discouraging - but with a little bit of neuroscience and psychology knowledge there's actually a world of tips &amp; tricks to be modified for us!)

Here's an organized list of some of my most important tips:

1. **Environmental &amp; Emotional Triggers**: if certain routines, environments, or moods are often present when you are picking, those will naturally (and subconsciously even) push your brain to urge you to pick. Although this is frustrating, the way our brains work is wonderful and also makes it possible to consciously rewire this habit! (\*\*These habits can actually be so deeply in our brain that we are absolutely unaware of them! (I recommend reading The Power of Habit if you're interested in learning more). For this reason, it can be helpful to pay special attention to particular locations that trigger picking, you might not be aware of all of them!)  

   1. **Begin by removing some of these triggers if possible** \- that might mean: turning the lights off in your bathroom or removing mirrors, keeping makeup wipes &amp; moisturizer in your bedside table, taking a shower every day, and taking special precautions on days where your anxiety, OCD, or depression is flaring up.
   2. **Try and replace your habit with something else** \- A large percent of scientists weighing in on this topic believe that habits can't be removed, only replaced. Personally, I've found that skincare routines can sometimes take the place of picking. If I get to the mirror and am about to pick, I try and keep a drying acne cream to dab on the spot, so that I feel like I've done something about the issue.
2. **Rewiring Triggers**: Once you are aware of these, and feel mentally strong enough to avoid the trigger, you can begin rebuilding the synaptic pathways that link the urge pick to the stimulus! By consciously introducing yourself to the triggering stimulus but not picking, you work to disconnect the synaptic pathways that associate your bathroom, for example, with the urge to pick.  

   1. For example - After I had made a little progress in picking, I made a point of deciding that I'd look at my skin up close in the bathroom (a trigger) and walk away. You can even set a timer on your phone for a few seconds to knock you out of that focused fog that sometimes takes over. Even washing your face in the dark in your bathroom has the same effect! By removing one trigger (seeing your skin), but still introducing the trigger of the bathroom, you can give yourself a leg up on beating that habit!
3. **Don't be too hard on yourself!** \- any time without picking is real progress! Even if you relapse or begin by picking a little, it's never too late to get back to working on beating the habit. Keep things in perspective by understand that one or even three really bad picking sessions aren't undoing the neurological progress you've made! It's totally normal to fail and that never means you're back at the beginning! Good luck :)  

   1. Shame plays a huge part in CSP and it's important to begin by recognizing it and slowly working through it. As many people have mentioned, CSP is highly co-morbid with anxiety, depression, and OCD and can be a coping mechanism for trauma. By understanding how each of the things going on in your mind affects the rest, you can gain a much more holistic understanding of CSP!",On Skin Picking &amp; Habit Breaking!

t2_2urmemyf,"I've been reading a lot recently on techniques to cope with my OCD and I've found that many people recommend ""accepting uncertainty"" as a method to overcome OCD. However, according to the author of an article I just read, accepting uncertainty ""does not mean you make up in your mind its 50/50"", but that the probabilities sometimes are usually so low they are negligible and therefore he's more able to get over them, that the uncertainty is easier to accept with confidence. But what about when the matter at trial in obsessions and doubt is actually 50/50, or even more? How do you accept uncertainty in that case? Does it mean that because my doubts and obsessions are close to being 50 % or more that they're true? Does it mean that in that case there would be no excape?

I've also kind of been seriously obsessing with whether or not my recent obsessions are OCD or not, whether its a lifetime sentence and if I'll ever get over them, making it an obsession by itself and making the matters worse. Actually, I even think this article can be very misleading to people suffering from OCD where his ""it's not 50/50 so just get over it because the chances are close to null"" doesn't apply. Hopefully someone can give me their opinion on this. I feel the more articles I read on the internet the more confused I get about my obsessions, and the less hope I get from feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

The quote I am referring to is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Accepting uncertainty does not mean accepting that there is a “1 out of 2” shot that your fear could be true.  What it means is you have abandoned the mandate to determine what the odds are in the first place.  As I write this, I am accepting the possibility, however small, that my computer is emitting some kind of toxic substance that may be giving me some kind of health issue.  I am further accepting that, merely by attending to writing this, I may be failing to attend to a more important matter, such as whether I may have committed some kind of crime earlier in the day.  To say these things is not to say that I believe these concerns are as likely to be true as a flip of the coin.  What I am saying is that the possibility simply exists at a level greater than absolute zero.  This allows for the understanding that the possibility may be so low, that I can treat it with such disinterest such that I refuse to even analyze *how* low the possibility is.

t2_18jhwey,"Hi everyone, I hope this is ok to post here, if not, feel free to delete this.

Like the title says, my husband has OCD. I've been reading the resources on this sub so I'll try and describe what he struggles with as best as I can. I try not to ask him too much about the specifics of what he struggles with because he gets really anxious when he feels he's not explaining things well (even if he is) and I don't like to put him through unnecessary distress, so I apologize if things are vague or aren't correctly labeled.

So he told me this started when he was young (middle or high school) and it seems that his main obsession is mental contamination. The way he explained it is that if he saw something disgusting, he would worry that the image would not leave his mind and that in the distant future at a really crucial or happy moment (like birth of his child or something) the image of that disgusting thing would pop into his mind and ruin his happiness. I think he would then obsess over the mental image but idk what rituals he had for that if any. He told me one of his compulsions at the time focused on looking at things over and over until he felt the mental image of that thing was aesthetically pleasing. Almost like taking photographs of something over and over until you got the framing just right. 

He told me he went to therapy for some time and it helped him a lot. It seems to me he is doing much better than he was back then but recently as our lives have gotten a bit stressful (money stuff), he seems to be struggling with his symptoms again although they're a bit different this time. For example, yesterday he was picking up our dog's poop and a little bit got on his finger. After he washed his hands, he offered to make coffee but he was struggling to find all the parts of our machine (we just moved). After bonking his head on a counter, he went to lie down. I went to talk to him and he said that he was dealing with this obsession where he felt that after touching the dog poop, the rest of the day was ruined. I have anxiety/depression and have done CBT before, so I said maybe he should challenge the thought (since that's the advice I was given) but he said he didn't want to do that because then he'd feel trapped into challenging the thought over and over. That his brain would make him list examples of how the day *wasn't* ruined until he felt satisfied. I offered instead to help distract him, help him think of things he liked or was happy about. He didn't say anything, we just kinda lay there holding each other and after a while he got up and was able to make the coffee and to my knowledge, didn't think of the dog poop again.

Is that the right thing to do, distract him? He is VERY prone to rumination. I think he tries to avoid triggering obsessive thoughts by trying to sleep when he's overwhelmed, but it seems to me it's a really unhealthy response as he avoids uncomfortable situations he HAS to do (like pay a bill). He also has a lot of health anxiety. His grandma once told him that people die after they feel happy and fulfilled, and after we got together, he got so anxious about it, he had a really awful panic attack.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that, at the very least, I need some validation that what I have been through isn’t just me ascribing some label for fun or out of ignorance. That what I’ve been through is at least note worthy, maybe not OCD, but maybe not great either. As a young woman of color it’s been hard to access resources and also believe my self in general, please be gentle with me, it’s hard enough to write this post.

When I was 13, I experienced what I now recognize as something similar to POCD. As an unsupervised kid on the Internet I saw things I very much didn’t need to, at one point I saw a “loli” image (idk too much about this soooo, that’s what I am gonna call it) and this spurred a year which turned into a constant battle  (I have a terrible memory when it comes to my mental health) even to today, of checking and testing and making sure I wasn’t a pedophile, yknow, the works. When I came to college I met a friend who experienced the same stuff, but back then I seemed like an isolated incident mixed with trauma.

Well, it turned out to be a bust, it seems like I spend so much time invalidating myself that I just forget how much, I guess, internal trauma, for lack of a better term, I’ve gone through. The first instance I felt this same paranoia/fear/fixation was when I was about 5 and I completely broke down to my mother as I was terrified of death, and her dying, and the fact I couldn’t control it. I was very young and my mom was freaked out, but she said the standard things a parent would, but ever since then it’s one of those thoughts I can’t control, even when I’m trying to relax or just be, the fear of death comes poking through. Which, sure that is everyone, but it’s painted an overcast over my life since then to a degree which seems unusual.

The next time I felt this feeling was at 13, when I vehemently decided I was an atheist the day of my first communion. I was in constant mental anguished during bible studies, considering why certain people were let in heaven, why anyone deserved to go, why the criteria as chalked up to be “asking God for forgiveness” and things of the sort. I couldn’t bear being part of the church, I felt inappropriate and fake, but the thoughts on morality and god never really left my mind.

Then 2012 rolled around and this sent me into a horrible, horrible year or so. I was 14 at the time, and it felt like a very real threat, I was gullible, but also incredibly paralyzed. I would check every new date they would post about which day the world was going to end. I did research and posted on forums and down every single day worried that I was going to miss the end of the world, that I wouldn’t be prepared. It was crying at night every day, it was watching the clock anxiously and everyone really took it as a joke, but everyday of that year felt the same, terrible dread, irremovable. Since it was such a meme at the time, not even my parents would take their child being in emotional distress very seriously (since they had gone through y2k, it obviously didn’t bother them). On one hand, I had a realist mother who would tell me we had no control over it and insisted I embraced the idea we would all end up in heaven. On the other, my conspiracy theorist dad validated everything I said and would send me links to more info.  They both were trying their best but I don’t think they understand how terrifying the situation was for me. This was the only other incidence that made me look up definitions for OCD at the time (with the POCD I also looked up symptoms).

And basically it goes on from there, almost every year there was something different layered on top of everything else. I’m bi, and although I am sure in my sexuality, every day I quantify my sexual/romantic attraction (which could also be internalized biphobia), but it’s stopped me from dating without feeling like a fraud, from participating in evens, from getting off comfortably without being struck by terrifying or disgusting intrusive thoughts (sexual violence and otherwise). That started around puberty and has followed me to today. Later in high-school, I had what I could only describe as a fixation with morality and spent hours in my room agonizing over what moral stances I take, why, what did this mean for me, and whether it made me an ultimately good or bad person (no middle ground) to the point of tears and exhaustion.  And when a family member suddenly past away, the intrusive thoughts about death came barreling back, which could also be grief, but it happened before when I was younger, only this time it had trauma attached. Once I came to college, the moral and existential rumination became stronger (I mistakenly took a lot of classes that might’ve fed into it all, like existentialism and ethics classes), and I find myself being politely interrupted by friends when I can go on for hours tops about different parts of a moral question and I am talking their ears off.

What I am meaning to say in all of this is that to me and others, it presents as general growth and thinking over things that plague us all. Even my therapist I have now has said that I shouldn’t peg this all on OCD. He says I have adjustment disorder and maybe a little anxiety, but that I am just a thoughtful and intelligent person. Which... that’s nice. And people say this a lot. And I do not even disagree... but it is, in my eyes, the results of years and ongoing years of internal anguish.  Am I just being dramatic, am I just going through things that people go through and am not strong enough to just leave them alone? Would you say these are problematic?

I believe they are problematic as... all of this occurs in the background until it doesn’t. Maybe one day I am feelings especially guilty about not doing well in school, and I get to thinking about why I’m here, an why I’m wasting my life away. And the general response would be to ignore all that, but to me it feels like I literally can’t help it. I get so depressed and sad and I can’t really talk to anyone about it because then I start going off incessantly or making people sad. I spiral for a few days, quietly, and then move on to obsessing over whether I’m just straight and being bi for  attention. It all switches on and off constantly, with age I have been able to cope with whatever is going on here, but the ability to semi-cope also makes me feel like I’m just weak and all of these intrusive thoughts are just thoughts and I’m stupid to believe I have some sort of disorder. 

I would also say I have compulsions, but they vary, and can often be spur of the moment instead of constant. My longest running ones are checking locks, checking my alarm clocks, checking for arousal, double checking if I’m breathing/if my heart is beating (this was one of my first ones, around the time I had the whole “terrified of death” thing as a kid), and some others.

I’m sorry this is very long, I just feel like I have some idea of what’s going on but don’t because everyone wants to insist I’m normal or smart or just having a tough time right now, and that it will end, but with recent self-reflection it feels like it’s been forever and that maybe I really am just the horrible person that my thoughts constantly insist I am, just really good at hiding it. It’s hard, I feel like I have had a good life otherwise and that I am just being weak, everyone else sees that I’m depressed and anxious and are absolutely dumbfounded because they obviously don’t see this stuff in my head.

I just need someone to say that this might not be just me, I don’t know. I just feel like if I can control all this, I’m a privileged sensitive brat who wants to be part of the OCD club. Thanks for getting this far if you did...

t2_3iv7crf4,"I really don’t want to do the whole ‘is this OCD’ thing but this would really help me categorise my mental health problems right now.

I have very strong fears that others will misinterpret me and assume I am doing something harmful or criminal.

Recently, these have been:

When waiting for my partner to finish work, I was parked round the back of his work. There was a group of women nearby. I was a lone guy sat in the only car just waiting. I was honestly just terrified about if they thought I was a stalker or sexual predator. I am gay and definitely not a sexual predator. To be clear, my fear wasn’t about *being* a sexual predator, but that others would think I am. When I went home I replayed the whole situation for the rest of the night, imagining what friends and colleagues would look like to those people just parked in a car park. I go on emotional ups and downs, thinking things like “well you are entitled to park there and wait” (which is rational) to thinks like “no, being sat in your car for ages looks weird and they definitely took a photo of you as a stalker”.

At work I have to walk to the car park, and the top level is dimly lit. If there are any women in front of me I have to walk past them to make sure they don’t think I’m following them. My heart sinks when I see people who might have misperceptions.

Security in shops makes me feel guilty and anxious, to the extent that I may act weird or attract attention. I have never stolen anything in my life, or wanted to, but the idea that someone could think I have is crippling.

When driving in a new place I think I may have run people over and not seen them. I have actually redirected my journey and gone around again before now to make sure there isn’t a corpse next to the curb  or something.

Sorry to make this so lengthy, but some of these differ from a lot of OCD stories in that I’m not fearing actually doing any of these things but that people will perceive that I intend to.

This might be more in common with paranoia or something, but I certainly do have my ruminations and rituals around them (I.e. replaying the situation in my head for days after, Googling, going through the journey in Google Maps to make sure I’m remembering everything).

It takes me a few hours to write one page of notes. This sounds like an OCD stereotype of “perfectionist”,  but I don’t mean caring too much about the neatness of my work. For reference, I use hexagon paper for organic chem. I’ll be writing out molecular structures, which are essentially just lines, and if my line doesn’t *exactly* match the line it was going over, I have to get a new sheet and start over again. Same thing with words not being straight and the same height, or even my letters being too close together on a single word. I spent 15 minutes lining up a ruler on the paper to take notes above it. If my notes are any different than what I consider perfectly symmetrical and neat, I need to start over. Ive noticed this got progressively worse when my ADHD started to get treated with adderall a few months ago. Avoiding cracks is something I’ve been able to adapt to, but this seems to be really holding me back in my class. I got a 29/100 on the last exam because I never finished half the notes. 

Not related: I do some things that drift from P OCD, I check my pocket for my keys 8 times before I leave my apartment and the microwave has to be in :48 second intervals.

t2_2go9gwx9,"Hello, So about 6 months ago at the peak of my issues i was diagnosed with severe OCD, Anxiety and Depression. I was put on Paroxetine and since it has gotten a little better, but I've still got lots of issues that i need to find a solution for.

I have a really bad problem with an obsession about my physical appearance and getting into a relationship with a girl but i will begin with the physical appearance and move on so it all makes sense. So I'll just say that I'm currently 15 and a half so still quite young, however i begun with these obsessions about a year ago. 

So in the last 6 months i have lost around 30KG and have gone from 108KG to 82KG. I'm 6'4"" so very tall and am now well into the healthy weight range. I'm not fat (even though i constantly convince myself that i am) in fact a lot of people would probably even consider me skinny. I really can't stand to look at my body and it's much worse in the shower when i look down. I'm convinced that i need my stomach needs to be perfectly flat and can't protrude from my body at all. 

My hip bones are sticking out of my body when i lay down and if i suck my stomach in, the bottom of my ribs are visible and i can put my hands around them. I lost 15KG in two weeks as i went completely anorexic in terms of my diet (still kinda am) and i didn't eat for a few days at a time. The obsession comes from seeing people on social media with really skinny torsos and i constantly think that is what i need to be in order to be accepted. 

My GP said that if i lose any more weight i will soon be considered underweight and she will put me in a hospital and diagnose me with Anorexia. I've lost more weight in three months than most people can in one year. As a result I've got some loose skin around my stomach which is causing it to appear more like a dad bod than skinny even though i am skinny under it all. 

My second physical obsession is my facial appearance. I never used to have a problem until my OCD started appearing about two years ago. I have convinced myself that i am the ugliest person in the world and everyone thinks so. I constantly hate myself and almost bring myself to tears over it. i do all this despite being told by everyone around me that I'm average or even good looking and attractive. I have used websites that have some form of AI and tells you based on your facial measurements how attractive you are and most have said I'm decently attractive. I have posted here on some sub Reddits that get people to comment on your appearance and lots have said that I'm cute and have good eyes and stuff. 

Female friends have commented when i have asked them and said that i looked good as well. When i am out in public occasionally i see girls looking at me as if they are interested. However i constantly dismiss all of this and convince myself that I'm ugly. I stand in the mirror some mornings and make myself suicidal because of how ugly i think i am. Other times i have actually been reasonable and thought i wasn't that bad but this is not very common. Even though i know deep down the truth my OCD keeps dismissing this and i spend hours everyday thinking about this over and over again. 

Now onto the second obsession. I have a massive obsession, possibly even bigger than the previous one that i talked about. It's that I'm constantly in fear and telling myself that i will be single for my entire life and no girl will ever want to even talk to me. This constantly effects my life and i think that i spend at least eight or nine hours a day thinking about it. It plagues my mind and often i do cry because of how real and scary the thoughts can be. However, this stems from the physical issue because i don't think it's going to be because of my personality, in fact my personality is one of the only things i actually like about myself. It's once again only a physical thing and i constantly think that a girl will never ever want to be with me because of my physical appearance. 

Obviously being 15, i have never had a girlfriend and am still a virgin. This only amplifies the issue as not only do i fear never getting a girls interest, i also fear about the virginity thing. Also not helping, I'm home schooled due to my Anxiety and Depression so i don't actually have a way to meet a potential girl anyway. I'm not worried now, in fact i wasn't even planning on getting one until i was 18 but it's just the constant fear and obsession that drives this pain inside me. 

I have tried to be rational with myself by explaining to myself that there are almost 4 billion girls on the planet and all of that and it never works. I've tried getting help but most people think that I'm just being stupid because they think i look fine and wont have any trouble.

I spend hours googling what girls find attractive and whenever i have the chance to ask someones opinion on my appearance i do. I constantly check if girls are looking at me. Some don't which is understandable but when they do and i can clearly see that they are checking me out i still dismiss and think that they are looking at me because of how extremely ugly i am. 

I have been planning an entire life around this and have even gone as far as to researching prostitutes in my area so when i'm 18 i can actually go and do some stuff with a girl. It's just controlling my life and i can't be happy. 

I'm always sucking my stomach in to make myself appear as skinny as i can when girls around. I change myself so much around girls that it almost makes it awkward because i'm not very good at being something that I'm not. Everyone can clearly see what I'm doing because it's so unnatural but i do it anyway.

Anyway, thank you so much for reading this far if you could have been bothered. I know i'm a mess and really can't be fixed. I appreciate you for taking your time though.

t2_2urmemyf,"I've seen many people talking about ""accepting uncertainty"" like it was finding goal in their path to overcome OCD.

For example, the uncertainty of my mom dying in a plane crash...yes, of course, it could happen, but chances are close to null. So accepting uncertainty in these kind of situations is easy, and as many recommend, you should just go with your first thought of intuition and not pay attention to the possibility of a negative outcome.

But... What happens when the odds are reversed, and the possibility of a negative outcome is the same or greater than the positive outcome? I am sure many OCD sufferers struggle with these kind of scenarios, in which it is not as easy as saying ""the chances are so low I'm not going to pay attention"". I feel these are the toughest scenarios, and at least in my case, the most challenging, knowing the odds are sometimes against me.

My partner lit a fire last night and it reminded me of the fear I felt trying to sleep at night at 17 years old. 14 years ago. Every time I think of that bad trip I have a panic attack.

t2_2rgslnob,"I guess I’m struggling with real event/false memory/memory distortion. Basically at the height of my ocd breakdown in November 2017 I remembered something that came up on a YouTube or reddit (I can’t remember) years before (2014-2015) that was sexual in context (but from robot chicken). However the character it was portraying was that punky Brewster or whatever.  Obviously this was in a very adult lewd way, but nonetheless.

Now, I have the slightest memory that I was simply not interested in this clip and simply forgot about it for years. I feel like because I forgot about it for so long that it was an insignificant blip. I feel like the heightened anxiety of my OCD caused me to assume straight away that I got off to it. 

Since 2017 I’ve been able to move on from this. I just passed it off as my OCD distorting it and accepted either reality (did or didn’t do it). 

Now during ERP watching a doco on pedophiles I was triggered and tried to check the YouTube clip to jog my memory and I feel horrible. I can’t accept the fact that I could’ve masturbated to this.

t2_331qfcw9,"I'll preface this by saying I'm 17 year old male. Even without mental illness, my life has been incredibly shitty. I'm not from a third world country or anything, but I've lived my entire life in poverty; experienced homelessness, sexual and domestic abuse, and extensive bullying.

Up until recently, the only thing I had a problem with was ADHD. After getting expelled for beating the shit out of a popular bully that was a year older than me in 7th grade in a fight he started, I went to a different school in a different state away from all my friends I'd had my whole childhood.

At this new school I was incessantly bullied. After having consistently been the top of my class in everything throughout my whole life, I had suddenly lost all motivation. My grades went to straight F's.

So then I went to another school three years later. I still didn't have any friends, but at this school (after two years) I met my first girlfriend, a stunningly gorgeous girl whom I had a ton in common with.

Suddenly life became too good to be true, but it didn't last long. When she left me I was once again friendless and I felt so much more hopeless than before. I became obsessed with her even though she no longer cared about me. Despite never talking to her anymore I constantly thought about.

I developed incredibly severe depression and terrible insomnia. I would wake up at a random time every day which lead to me dropping out of high school.

This is where my mental illnesses become a severe problem. I'm naturally an incredibly introverted person. Even with my closest friends, I can't handle being around people for more than an hour (unless it's a romantic interest) before I need to be by myself. This is part of why school has always been such an intense struggle for me.

Me having dropped out lead to me never having to be around people and my introversion lead to me being all too comfortable with completely isolating myself.

Once human interaction became a minimum I started making things up in my head to satisfy my overwhelming boredom.

Eventually, my inner monologue would start changing voices and I began seeing things that weren't there - such as a deer downtown that no one else saw.

My anxiety became severe. If someone starts talking to me now I begin shaking uncontrollably.

All of sudden I think everything's a conspiracy.

My ADHD has become insurmountable due to the time I've spent not doing anything. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that within ten seconds, my attention span for any given task has ended.

Once I was done obsessing over my ex my brain could only replace the hole by moving on to a new obsession. This lead to OCD. Very severe OCD.

I used to absolutely love reading. It was my favorite thing. I'd read for 12 hours a day. K can't do it anymore. My OCD forces me to reread every single paragraph over and over to make sure I get every detail, and then I immediately forget and have to read it again. It takes me four hours to read everything.

I've also convinced myself that every pole I walk past I have to touch, or else my mental stability will weaken even further.

Intrusive thoughts are the worst of all though. For me the most important thing has always been my identity. Who I am as an individual. I've always known exactly who I am but that's exactly what my OCD is attacking, and for whatever reason it's making me question who I am.

I pick one possibility. That possibility that once seemed nearly impossible will suddenly seem more and more likely over the course of two weeks and it will drive further and further away from sanity. The thought will follow me every second that I'm not preoccupied. It's the last thing I think about before I go to sleep, it allows me two hours of that in which it invades my nightmares, and then it's the first thing I think about when I wake up after a very brief slumber.

After two weeks that horrifying thought will have nearly brought me to suicide at which I point I think ""Fuck it, it if that is who I am, so what."" And then it's gone. As soon as I've accepted that it's a possibility, it no longer is one. And then I think I'm okay.

A few days pass and then another thought that has been slowly building since I abandoned the last one will serve as a replacement. This keeps happening, over and over and over again, and each thought is worse than the last. And none of them have been true, yet they're still killing me.

At this point I've accepted that my cause of death will inevitably be suicide. I daydream about not having to exist anymore, I just have to let one of these thoughts push me to the limit.

It's bizarre because a year ago I knew exactly who I wanted to be and I had a clear and personal sense of right and wrong. I still have that - I just don't know it anymore, I only *think* I know it, which means that I really do know it, I just think I don't. If only I knew now what I knew then.

My mood will rotate back and forth between euphoric happiness and suicidal urges in a matter of seconds, then go straight back to happiness. Oh well.

t2_3izj1tzc,"I will keep this very helpful means of help that stops some OCD thoughts dead short, but, add to it if anyone becomes interested. 

First a little about myself. I have had OCD since age 19. I am in my early 60's and in spite of the disorder I have a graduate degree in mathematics. For the last two years I have been working on a project involving Artificial General Intelligence which required a lot of effort spent on areas involving the discipline of philosophy of the mind, specifically the subjective nature of our being.

What I discovered in my work led to a watershed moment with respect to what my OCD primarily focuses on. The disorder's focus is scruples. There have been times I had been lost for hours in ruminations leading to panic over my footstep along the ground in my back yard was perhaps wrong in the moral sense.

What I have discovered in my work is that wrong/right, bad etc are emotional views that are entirely subjective. They are not properties of the object like melts at 32 is a property of ice. 

We often through childhood training or being unaware of their subjective nature see these emotional views as properties of the object which they are not. Hence, if you try to create comfort for your emotional being by showing that the moral wrong envisioned as perhaps a property of where I placed my foot as it touched the ground is false you will try to no avail and just succumb to continuous hopeful rumination that only leads to panic.

Once you realize the emotive/moral wrong is completely subjective and not a property of the object, in this example where I stepped on the ground, then like the unicorn does not exist and (not unicorn) where in (not unicorn) unicorn is  real also does exist the following is true: Neither the emotive/moral wrong envisioned as an objective property nor emotive/moral not-wrong envisioned as an objective property exists in reality. 

The splendor in this is you can stop trying to show yourself that what you did was wrong is false in a manner similar to showing 5 +3= 7 is false because the objective properties seen as moral-wrong/moral-not-wrong do not exist in reality hence you can stop. 

Wrong, not-wrong as well as a host of other emotional views are never objective properties of the object these views are directed. Hence, there is never any real need to show your self they are not fitting for they can not be and it is only an illusion of the mind or encouragement by those who wished to control your behavior that has led you to the false belief.

t2_9g7msu1,"So, OCD and ADHD are supposed to be polar opposites in the brain, with OCD being caused by overstimulation of dopamine and ADHD being caused by understimulation of dopamine (sort of - I'm not a doctor).  So what's happening right now for me is kind of unusual.  Let me give you some backstory.


Had OCD quirks my whole life but never to clinical levels until I started having babies.  Was diagnosed ADHD when I was a child, but stopped taking meds because my mother thought they were making me wet the bed.


Went on phentermine for weight loss after one of my children and seemed to start to do better with my OCD.  Phentermine is in the same family of medications as amphetamine-based ADHD medication.  Stopped the phentermine because weight loss doctor stopped treating me.  Had another baby, OCD got worse again.


Finished having babies, got on all kinds of antidepressants, started seeing little changes for the better but not doing ERP yet because hadn't found a therapist yet.  One day found one of my old phentermine and decided to try it out for appetite suppressant that day, ended up doing a lot of work around the house and didn't do a lot of the rituals I usually do.


I read up on ADHD.  Turns out I have a lot of the symptoms, which is not all that odd since a lot of people with OCD and ADHD share symptoms.  Talked to psychiatrist about maybe having ADHD despite definitely also having OCD.  She gives me a prescription for Ritalin so I can try it out.


Now, we are getting ready to move.  I decide to make the house a 'camping' zone instead of a 'clean' zone.  Am doing better and better about not making a difference between inside and outside.  Sometimes I make great OCD-killing strides when on Ritalin, sometimes when off.  Still a little jittery on the medication if I haven't eaten well, but it does help me calm down at other times.


I can't tell if it's the Ritalin that is helping me or not!  At this point I honestly don't know if it's just that my hormones are finally calming down after pregnancy (10 months post-partum) or that my antidepressants are doing their job or that my brain is somehow changing the way it processes dopamine.

Also, while I was reading, there were these really small flakes that looked like bugs that fell off the page.

t2_24pt0pva,"Hi friends. OCD being the fun time that it is gets me in a particular bind when it comes to bats and rabies. I once had a bat in my room at night and had to get vaccinated. Ever since, my OCD has provided thousands of ways in which I have potentially been infected. As a result, I have received the vaccine post exposure vaccines more than once. So, not only do I have to worry about rabies, I then worry I have too much rabies vaccine. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

It's been two years since I last received any rabies vaccine, but my OCD is acting up again. I was walking home from a bar pretty shit-faced two nights ago. I saw something on the sidewalk that looked a lot like a dead bat. I was almost on the verge of blacking out, but I think my mind came rushing back as a trigger warning because of my fear of bats/rabies-- I recall coming upon the bat and being shocked, not it coming down and swooping at me. I live in New York City, in Manhattan. Bats don't often swoop down on folks around here unless it is Batman himself. That said, I took a photo of it that isn't particularly great as I can't really tell what it is. I also wrote myself a note about the incident on my phone but the note makes almost no sense because I was drunk. I mentioned ""stomping"" but I think I meant I stomped to get anything off my shoes in case I stepped on it, which I don't think I did. But I was also shit faced. However, if I was knowledgable enough to take a photo and write myself a note, I would assume I also would have warned myself of an exposure. I should also note I wrote ""nothing happened"", which I think refers to a non-exposure event.

Now I am in a muck of wondering whether to get rabies post exposure shots-- it is only two vaccines, but they cost a lot of money in the US and I don't have any clear evidence for exposure. Unfortunately my lexapro hasn't been working so well (I'm on 10 mg- low dose) so I also take Klonopin. If i didnt have my klonopin, I'd have been in the ER already making up a story about a definite exposure to get the vaccine. 

I've walked by the scene a few times since, but obviously whatever this thing is is gone...

I have been doing well the past couple of week with therapy and medication for my scrupulous OCD, like so good that I have been really surprisingly happy. But recently I feel like a new kind of OCD is creeping in and I don't know what it is or how to deal with it and I am just trying my best to handle it but I feel like I can't.

Basically, my usual OCD is me feeling like no matter what I do I am disappointing God, and therefore sinning so I rehearse confession for days reexamining every little thing, stay away from communion often because of the fear and guilt, ya know, the usual scrupulous stuff. But just today my friends criticized me in a totally normal way, they just told me that they think I shouldn't nap so much because I'm letting life pass me by, idk, but that shouldn't be a big deal right? Well, for some stupid reason it is, and I just cannot stop thinking about how much of a disappointment I am, and I feel so much guilt and anxiety because of it. And the guilt and anxiety are at the same level that my scrupulous anxiety used to be before I started doing so well. For some reason, all I want to do is rehearse confessions to relieve this, but I have nothing to confess (I just went to confession on Sunday) so I don't have a compulsion to relieve the guilt from this tiny criticism and it just keeps building. I know I am not supposed to use compulsions to relieve my guilt, and I have been doing such a good job not giving in to compulsions lately, but I know that right now if I had a compulsion for this guilt and anxiety I would do it in a heartbeat. Honestly, I don't even know if what I am feeling is OCD, but I am so anxious and I feel so isolated because I am so anxious over such a STUPID thing.

t2_1fu0jgbg,"This might sound silly but I have been dealing with the fear of my glasses getting dirty for about 15+ years.  It's gotten so bad that I was at the point where I had to check them every 10 or so minutes and if I even saw one tiny speck or smear I would HAVE to clean it right away.  I could not ignore it no matter how much I tried.  This would then lead me to clean them for hours on end making sure they were perfect again and lead me to sleeping during the day after I cleaned them so I could avoid wearing them and getting them dirty before I had something I had to do, like work.

Eventually after many years I got the idea of contacts.  I really wouldn't be able to clean something that's in my eye right?  Well at first I did great and was wearing them no problem, now, my OCD has taken over again.  Every night when I go to clean them and place them in their case I HAVE to check each side multiple times for hairs or anything else that might be in there soaking with contacts.  At first I was double checking once or twice but now it's 5+ times everytime.  And of course opening and closing them so many times little hairs are getting in causing me to dump out the entire solution and start the process all over again. There's been a few nights where I've gone through half a bottle of solution because of this.  I even tell myself every time before I take them out that I'm going to clean them put them in solution close the lid and put them away but then I always tell myself ""Just one little check."" And of course I check once and then that leaves me to checking again and again repeating the process of dumping out the solution and refilling it do to tiny hairs getting in from opening it excessively.  Now I have tried checking it once and then closing it up and putting the case with my contacts in them away but then I'll lay in bed and obsessively think about it until I get up and go check them again.

Most days I can go about my business and not have anyone notice. I've learned how to cope in the environment I'm in. However, there have been some changes at work recently that are making it harder to handle things discretely. That and they want me to take on extra responsibilities and duities, and it's making things harder.

One of my OCD behaviors is removing all stickers from the front and back of computers and monitors. You know, things like service tags? I honestly thought monitors just lasted for years and that I would be replacing them all in a few years.

It turns out that even though the monitor is within warranty, the service company has no way of helping me without that little sticker.

It was also SO embarrassing having to think of an explanation for the confused person on the phone as to why all the stickers were missing that didn't make me sound like a black market criminal.

Lesson learned: this sh\*t has a financial cost. I know going to therapy does too, but I'm sure that living with this might ultimately cost more. It's good to be reminded of that sometimes.",I hate when OCD behaviors cost money,OCD,2,bjf42y,False

So I wondered how people deal with avoidance?

I'm struggling to take out my trash and it's just piling up and I'm avoiding it. I'm aware of it, and scared of it, every second of the day. 

I try to take it out on Sundays which is trash day but I end up high anxiety with loads of intrusive thoughts (what if there's human bones in there, your DNA is all over it etc etc etc) and I end up bringing it back in and ending up with the same crap and a lot more stress.

My compulsions are about 40% under control at the moment. I just don't know how to deal with avoidance and I only get to talk to my therapist once a month. Please offer your stories or some insight into this?

So yesterday I returned home to my rented house (where I live with two housemates) and found the back door and our yard gates wide open with no one home. I knew straight away the housemate who was responsible. This certain housemate is extremely slack when it comes to turning off lights and cleaning up after himself and I've let alot of things slide with him (due to not having the confidence to stand up for myself).
It concerned me, because I have belongings in my room that are important and expensive. Anyone could of easily walked off the street, into the house and taken anything. I know the possibility isn't that high here, but you never know. Best to be safe, surely?

So this morning, I worked up the courage and sent a message to the group (my two housemates) asking him nicely if he could just make sure he locked up when going out. This was a massive thing for me, confidence wise.

But here's the issue: I feel.. guilty. I feel like I'm being over the top. Petty. A 'goody goody'. 
I'm an extremely chilled housemate, but I can't help obsessing over this. That I should just.. let it slide and be chilled with the fact that our house was unlocked and the door open to the street. I worry that my housemates will think I'm being an over the top jerk. These thoughts are frequently interrupted with my head telling me that I did the right thing. I know it's the OCD and the extreme lack of confidence. But fuck. It's exhausting.
My housemates are really shit to live with and do a lot of things that make it miserable to live here (I've handed in my notice and moving on thank fuck) but I can never find the confidence to stand up for myself with them. This makes me feel pathetic.

t2_1ctp7o3b,"Hello! I suffer from Scrupulosity (Religious OCD) and I've had a very traumatizing and scarring experience with religion (not victimizing myself) and as a result I tend to avoid (as people with OCD do) my religious uncles. My uncles are very religious and live in Iowa. Two years ago, I went to live with them for the summer and once it ended I came back. Ever since then, my uncles are constantly calling and pushing me to move to Iowa with them and go to the local state college to study filmmaking. They say the push me to live with them because they believe Iowa is the best place for me and that I'm a good person when I'm there. I've always been a good and kind person, no matter where I'm at (I was, in terms of kindness, the same person I was while I was there). Before my obsession came along, their insistence didn't bother me at all but I always declined for I had no attraction to living or studying at Iowa (they don't even offer my major) or, in other words, it wasn't in my heart. But now that I have an obsession/irrational fear with religion and I avoid my uncles, I've become obsessed with the idea that I want to go to Iowa (as well as the fear that it really is the best place for me) and I just don't know it or  that I'm in denial. The root of this new obsession is still religion. I fear it just because it's born out of religious people. I always hear one should face their fears in order to heal (and in a way I'm doing it through building a tolerance to the anxiety). When I used to be calm and managed to analyze the situation with no emotional bias, I really had no desire to study or live in Iowa; there's no attraction to life there and the fact they don't even offer my major is an indicator I shouldn't even go there. My anxiety is telling me that living in Iowa is the right choice and I'm doing the wrong thing in not going, something I don't want to do and I know is born out of fear.

I feel like I'm developing OCD. I've been feeling extremely stressed for about a few weeks now as I have university exams. Ever since 2 days ago, I have been repeating a specific phrase in my mind. It pops up in my head occasionally, probably several times an hour.

I have never been diagnosed with OCD, but I used to have exactly this same problem (and surprisingly, one of the phrases I would repeat was exactly the same as this one now) when I was 13-14. It was much more severe at the time, and I would repeat words constantly (every 2-3 seconds). I also used to have physical compulsions like checking the door handles, etc. I remember waking up one day and realizing I wasn't doing any of that anymore, i.e. my OCD had completely disappeared on its own, which I'm so thankful for.

My twin sister was diagnosed with OCD when we were 17-18 because she was repeating phrases over and over in her head (but more severe, also having inappropriate thoughts etc.)

I only have 2 weeks left of exams. How could those two weeks affect me though... I don't want this to turn into full blown OCD (I don't even know if that sounds reasonable).

I'm honestly really scared. For someone who's lived his entire life thinking that some miracle saved him from OCD, for this to happen now, it's causing me so much anxiety.

* Is his sterility being caused by something we can't treat?
* Is it being caused by something dangerous for him?
* Am I also infertile, meaning that if we did eventually want kids we couldn't even do IVF?
* Do I also have something wrong with my health? (my fertility bloodwork was a bit weird, leading me to worry about medical issues)

Well, last week was absolutely horrible but with a few followup doctor visits, we learned that his sterility was caused by him not having a vas deferens.  He was born without it.  Meaning that if we DO want to have kids, IVF is an option because he most likely makes sperm.  We also learned that I have a normal amount of eggs and no major ovary problems, another thing I was worried about.

Watching shows/movies - In the back of my mind, I always feel like I need to finish shows that I can just finish them as I have a list in my head, it weighs heavily on me and I feel like I sometimes can't enjoy movies/shows as I really just gotta get them off my list. an example of this, right now im watching brooklyn 99 and I feel like I must finish it and then watch GOT from the beginning, but that weights on me as I know I have to watch The office from season 2 and then I have like a bunch more shows to finish so that I know that I actually finished them and crossed the list.

Gaming - I have a list of games and I always feel like I must go through a game to finish it just so that I can cross it off of a list, sometimes I wont fully enjoy the game but ill play it so that I can finish it.

That's it without going into so much details.

I feel like the cleaning/shows/gaming is something that must have some sort of order and arrangement so that I can rest my mind.

t2_36yzpsf,"TL;DR - My psychiatrist of 6 years has never told me what I'm diagnosed with and she probably won't unless I ask but how do I ask? things, I figure whatever she asks is related to what the diagnosis is. My therapist seems convinced I have OCD (fairly obvious, my psychiatrist has mentioned it a few times but hasn't outright said I had it, only implied) and chronic depression. My psych has mentioned I do have some signs of psychosis, more specifically ""you seem a bit more aggressive and have trouble differentiating reality from your own thoughts"".

My psychiatrist has prescribed me various medications - Lexapro, Deplin, Buspar, Prozac, Abilify; sometimes a combination of at most 3. I have frequent hallucinations, on a daily basis. Mostly visual but sometimes olfactory (most recently some sort of cologne in one corner of my kitchen which I cleaned repeatedly and it didn't go away for several days), tactile, and auditory. The visual ones are no longer frightening, I've gotten pretty use to them and dismiss them fairly quickly.  Some other earmarks of psychosis come and go. My psychiatrist requested my mom take me to a neurologist when I was 15 (when I first went in, almost 21 now). My mom thought nothing was legitimately wrong with me and refused. 

I want to know what I have, I know she has to tell me but I don't think she will unless I ask. I'm a little scared of what it could be but if I know, I could find better ways to fix it.

t2_2roi9j3i,"Hi everyone! After looking through this sub and reading a lot of people’s stories, I’m pretty positive I have “pure O” OCD. I’m constantly (and I mean, CONSTANTLY) having intrusive thoughts about my relationship. Lots of intrusive, graphic images of my partner sleeping with his exes, lots of worrying that his exes were somehow better than me, etc. Retroactive jealousy to the point that I break down and cry all the time. I’m also struggling a lot with trust, and am ALWAYS worrying about my partner potentially cheating on me although he’s given me absolutely no reason to worry. This has been happening for the entire year and a half I’ve been in this relationship. I used to think this was just because of my own insecurities, but the extent to which I’m constantly, always worrying makes me think it’s more than that. I just can’t switch it off, ever. I’m really considering treatment since this is really hurting my boyfriend and I.

However, I can’t find any therapists in my area that mention using ERP for their OCD patients - just ACT and CBT. Does anyone have experience with either of those? I’m worried I’ll end up wasting time and money if I commit to a therapist that I know doesn’t use ERP, since I’ve read that ERP is often the best type of therapy for OCD.

t2_ig8vv,"Today I found out about Pure O OCD and I cried. Cried because it was a reminder that I wasn’t going to be able to “trick myself” my whole life and crying because it’s explained my difficulties more than any other diagnosis I have received.

I was diagnosed with GAD at age 14, Depression shortly after, ADHD as a college student, and BED then as well. While I struggled with the initial anxiety diagnosis, I was mostly numb to the other ones. I would go to therapies or take meds specifically targeting these things. I’m still on a med for anxiety, for depression, and for ADHD. So 3 different ones. 

Yet none of this ever seemed to have any lasting impact. Lately, Mindfulness and meditation have really appealed to me. I can now see why. It gives me the ability to accept the intrusive thoughts I have without interacting with them. 

I’ve experienced fear of hurting or killing my husband, family, and myself constantly throughout my life. I’ve been terrified of cheating on him, being unable to be care or love him (even though I do). I’ve worked with children for a long time and have feared being a pedophile. These don’t all occur at the same time by in waves. 

I fear running my car into people and other cars. I fear getting rid of certain items will prevent me from remembering something important about a relationship even if that item is very trivial. This has led to some hoarding and a very untidy living situation. 

What follows all these thoughts is the intense feeling that I am a terrible person for feeling this way and should not think those things. I try to FORCE myself to not think them. 

I have less of the internal compulsions now, but I feel that may be partially due to the amount of medication I take. 

Don’t get me wrong, meds can be very helpful for many and have helped me through tough times, but I think I have relied on them for too long and have not felt the full extent of my obsessions in a decade. For me, that’s debilitating because I cannot face them head on.

t2_wh5wd,"Hi all. I don’t really know if this post is going to have much direction, I apologize. I’m just coming down from a major freak out and could use some support from people who understand. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 19. I’m now almost 27. I also had my second baby a few months ago (who’s wonderful! Just normal baby sleep taking a big toll).  I put a trigger warning on because I describe a sort of anxiety attack. 

Anyway. It started today when I got it in my head I needed to watch the newest Jeopardy episode. It would be a good night and I’d have a good day tomorrow if I could make it happen. But we don’t have cable or a DVR and the kids bedtimes interfere with the local airtime. So I spent a good 2 hours trying to find a way to watch. Streaming sites, free trials of YouTube and CBS, geo spoofing, VPNs you name it I tried it. Nothing worked. I was trying to make it work before the last airtime and I was watching the clock get closer and closer. When it all failed, I snapped. It started as silently crying and trying to calm myself, but it just escalated to the point where I was screaming and hit my head on the floor a couple times. I also scratched all down my face with my fingernails and have awful scratches now. I only stopped because I’d accidentally woken the baby by yelling like I did and I hate losing control like that because it scares my husband and I hate hate hate making him feel that way. 

I think there were several other contributing factors (lack of sleep, my husband’s work schedule changing like 20 times today, potty training a toddler, eating junk, moving in 6 months etc.) but this is the straw that broke the camels back. I have a problem with making plans in my head and when those go awry, it sends me into a tailspin. Like tonight I thought we’d watch jeopardy and have dessert then go to bed. Tomorrow my husband was going to be off work so I could maybe get an extra hour of sleep but instead he’s going on early AND working this weekend. 

I’m sorry for how long this got, I just need to put something out there so it doesn’t keep festering. Do any of you have freak outs like that with self injury?

First of all, I have not been diagnosed with OCD, so I’m not trying to self diagnose here, but this is something I’ve been doing for about a couple years now, and Ive always thought that I was the only one in the world that did this and that I was some kind of nutjob 

Basically, I have this thing where every day, during specific parts of the day, I mentally (and sometimes out loud) say “Nothing bad will happen to me or any of my loved ones or idols today(night) or any time soon” as well as other things, then I knock on wood with the idea that if I don’t knock on wood, my thoughts will be jinxed and none of those things will come true. 

I have a specific schedule on this too, during night, right before I sleep, I list 30 things that I want to come true mentally, then knock on wood. And if I knock improperly, I feel like I have to do it again properly or else everything will be jinxed.

During the day, around 11:45 AM, I list 5 things I want to become true, and do the same thing

At 2:05 PM, I list 10 things I want to become true and repeat the routine. 

Also if somebody else talks over me while I’m doing this, I feel the urge to repeat the whole process all over again uninterrupted, so it gets me mad at times.

And I’m a high school student so in class when I do this I look crazy to some people because they think I’m talking to myself (which I am fair enough but I’m not actually having a convo with myself) 

My point is, I’m sick of this and I want to see if anyone else experiences this too and how they get rid of it. 

Once again, I always thought I was the only one who does this so I was shocked when I found out that this was a common symptom of a type of OCD, I thought I was just really really really really superstitious.  

Once again I don’t know whether I have OCD or not because I haven’t been diagnosed 

I have other things I do like this too: in the shower I have to turn off the cold water before the hot water, in the school bathroom I have to use a specific urinal, when I walk to places in my school I have to take a specific path, it’s maddening and I think it’s taking over my life 

TL;DR: Very superstitious tendencies in the form of tedious tasks that I feel like I have to do or else it will screw up my life, such as walking down specific pathways, excessive praying like rituals at certain times of the day, and very picky on my routines in general and I wanna see if other people have these problems or something similar and how I can get over them","Excessive knocking on wood, and other things",OCD,9,bjr1gp,False

I’ve had periods of time where I wouldn’t sleep for fear of dying while sleeping, where I had obsession with manual breathing/my heartbeat, fears of going insane, losing my mind or hurting myself/others, and fears that nothing was real and that everything was made up in my head.

A few weeks ago, I started focusing a lot on my breathing out of nowhere, I couldn’t stop controlling it manually and I started feeling off. It’s been about 6 years since my last panic attack, and 3-4 years since the last time I got stuck on an old obsession (which normally subsided after a day or two). I decided to start on Fluoextine again (which I had stopped a few years ago) and everything was going okay for a bit. I felt better just knowing I was taking a step to push away this obsession again and start feeling normal.

However, thing started getting weird after 1.5 weeks of taking the medicine. Last Thursday at work I had a weird episode of what felt like low blood sugar or low blood pressure or something. I felt like I couldn’t breathe right and my heart slowed down and I had diarrhea, it sucked. I stayed at work and pushed through it. Friday, same thing, same time of day (around lunch). This time I texted my boss from the parking lot and told her I needed to go. She came down and talked to me and gave me a hug and was very supportive. I went to the ER, and they tested my blood sugar which was 98 which was pretty normal. They said to stop drinking coffee (easier said than done) and that I seemed okay now and to follow up with my PCP.

So this past Saturday I stayed at home on my day off and had another weird attack. Feeling like a drop in my body, like all the blood went to my feet, and I had diarrhea again too. I was so confused. I wasn’t stressed or anxious I was just sitting and felt fine all morning and it hit me around 12:30-1pm. And then Sunday I felt fine, no attacks, I hung out with my partner, we ate food went to the mall and no episodes or attacks or whatever.

Monday I was super anxious to go back to work after my weird attacks on Thurs/Fri. Despite my nerves, I was fine all day. I felt anxiety, which I can handle, but I didn’t have an episode or attack like before. Same thing happened on Tuesday too. I was feeling good like it was all over. But then yesterday, Wed, it happens AGAIN. I stay at work until the end of my shift and I talk to my boss, who is still supportive and concerned, saying I need to take care of myself.

None of this feels like panic or OCD related anxiety, but idk what’s going on. Does any of this sound normal to you?

I have been struggling with POCD for about a year now. Originally it was towards young girls because my ex, who although was older (F23) than me (M20), looked much younger than she actually was (she was short, skinny, and petite with smaller breasts and backside). I've been able to come to terms with it and it's not crippling anymore, but my mind has moved toward young boys. 

Whether in real life or in animation/anime, I've started to notice young boys more. I don't believe I am sexually attracted to them, but I have had the thought and contemplation ""I guess I can see why some pedophiles go after young boys."" A long time ago, when I heard about child rapists like jeffrey dalmer and how he went after young men and boys, it baffled me, I could not understand why. But now, I looking at the young male form, I guess I can to an extent. It's a disturbing thought, yet not as disturbing as it should be.

I don't look for child porn that real or animated, in fact my tastes in that department are what would be considered normal (sexually mature women/men), but the thought of other stuff creeps into my mind, and I don't know if it is because I genuinely want to or because I am obsessing.

I'm completely unable to get rid of these thoughts, although they do sometimes subside in severity, and I often end up repeating certain phrases in my head to try and get rid of them. I also find that I constantly look at my body to check whether I feel normal about it, and to confirm a lack of dysphoria. I know I am a man, and yet I constantly have thoughts questioning this; which is particuarly hard to deal with. I am already seeing a therapist over the health anxiety, yet I haven't told them because I am deeply and truly terrified they'll misdiagnose me as having gender dysphoria.

Ok, and then I saw these other tiny unidentifiable brown bugs, that I now think are baby roaches, in my bed. I researched them for hours that night, I couldn’t stop.

I had a panic attack over some bugs in my room.

I have researched the shit out of it, trying to identify whatever I see around the house, and solutions.

I don’t know how I’m ever going to be comfortable sleeping in my bed again, especially now since I’m also seeing around 3 spiders a day in our house/in my room. If I tried sleeping in my bed tonight I’d be up all night, hyper-vigilant to any kind of slight movement on me, thinking it’s a bug crawling on me. Absolutely paranoid.

t2_3vbgwxwd,"Hey new to the whole Reddit thing. I’m sorry if I don’t do this correctly. I was dating this guy for 2.5 years. I would consider him my first real serious first love relationship. Throughout the time dating him he opened up to me about his ocd and how and why it culminated. A lot of tough conversations but I really loved and cared about him so I fought through. I deal with my own mental health issues plus the same with my family so I did my best to learn and understand ocd. At the 2 year mark he went out with his friends and got drunk and cheated on me. He told me the next day and of course at that moment I left him. Over that month though we talked and I decided to take him back. He was a good bf before that night and I felt like he def just fucked up. I set up ground rules and had all the tough talks. Why did he do it, why did it come out of the blue, was he happy with me? Attracted to me? If we took each other back would be happy especially knowing the relationship would not be the same. Knowing it would be hard. In the end he wanted it and we continued. It was rough at first but he gave me support, space, told me he would answer any and all question whenever I had any. He would be there to prove he loved and cared about me and he regretted it. It wasn’t just words but actions that took place too. He set up date nights and of course money and objects won’t make up for pain but he bought me flowers and little surprises here and there. He liked guns and video games. He sold all of it and gave me the money because he knew I was struggling and it would help me. He was good about money and I could see the happiness in his face that he had us back. Of course I had anxiety bouts every now and then but I reached out to him for reassurance. We had talks about if this is what he really wanted, if he was happy, and if my anxiety about cheating was to much for him I would tone it down. Because I Know constantly asking wouldn’t help in the end either. Anyways over the months it got better and I felt we were both happy. Now he was in school and about to graduate. He got a job offer in a different city and had to move when he graduated. That’s somethibg we talked about. At first he told me to not worry about it just focus on us first and as time for closer I made my decision to move out with him. He was ecstatic about it. We went out to the new city and looked around and everything. He seemed happy that I was going to and continue to be with him. Then about a month ago we met up after both a stressful day. He seemed normal. As we were driving to get ice cream he breaks down and I ask him what’s wrong. To tell me. Overall he told me he loved me but a smaller part of him feels like he would live with regret. We talked about hard things which led the conversation to him ending it with me. He told me he was confused as to what decision to make. He loved me but he would see other girls and think what would life be like with them. He also talked to his dad earlier that day and his told him maybe he should let this be his first love and who knows maybe we would reconnect later in life. (His dad cheated on his mom twice; now divorced) that night I didn’t yell at him or fight him or put him down. I just accepted it and told him that I’ll always love him and would forever grateful for all the help he offered me through out our relationship. That I wasn’t with him for his money or anything like that. I would stay with him if he didn’t graduate or couldn’t find a job or we stayed in the same city. As long as he was next to me that’s all that mattered but I accepted it. Kissed him and ugly cried hugged him and dropped him off. My question is over this past month of course I’ve gone through a lot of emotions. But I feel like he ended it because of “rocd” or his General ocd. In the past he one time started crying saying he felt like when I finished school (he wanted to help put me through school to finish) that I would just leave him. I reassured him I would never do that. He also told me he was afraid of commitment. During this past month I ended up giving in and messaging him. Not to convince him to come back. I don’t want to force anybody in a relationship. But just to tell him final things that I didn’t say that night because just emotions were high. I told him I’ll forever love him, grateful towards him, never hate him, and it broke my heart he left but I just want him to be happy. He messaged back quickly and said he didn’t hate himself (he said that a couple of times) and that he wasn’t ready for the commitment we were preparing for (in my view point he’s the one who set everything up. Never asked him to pay for my school or told him to make me move with him. He’s the one who even brought up marriage at a point which I told him maybe a couple years down the road) and that he was going to be unhappy out there with me. I did not reply to his message but again as time passed I feel like all of this was a result of “rocd”. Do you think I should message him saying I hope he is okay and that I hope he seeks help for his ocd because I felt like the break up was due to his ocd or rocd? Or should I just leave him alone? I still care about him and I just want him to be okay.

Driving - I get flashes of horrific deaths of myself or members of my family dying.  I haven’t been able to drive more than 10 mins at a time in the last 7 years and won’t drive on fast roads like motor ways and dual carriage ways.

Peeing - I have to pee at least twice (often more) before I can go to sleep because I worry I will be up all night with nightmares and disrupted sleep if I don’t.  I also won’t sleep for at least 2 hours after my last drink to give everything time to “pass through”.

I am worried about finding another job, but not to the point of being really anxious.

Thing is, I just arrived yesterday to the city and all the fears and anxiety went back, to the point that I am seriously considering returning home.

I do not know if it is because of the job interview, or because small travels always make me nervous. But I was supposed to have a good time and I am not. I am full with anxiety and I want to cry all time.

I will not return home since I know it will be a getaway, but it is not fair that I cannot even enjoy a friendly trip.

I’m not trying to write anymore posts regarding this but it’s bothering me so much right now. I think I have something called POCD, fear of being or becoming a pedophile. I’m 14 years old by the way. I know already that I like girls my age or older. I’m just concerned that I might also like children. I don’t mean like 12-14 years of age children. I mean like everything under that age, even sometimes babies I worry I might be aroused too. Yesterday I wanted to test myself again, I’ve done it a lot already I just don’t remember how much I’ve done it. I test myself whenever I’m around children IRL, seeing if I like their voice, their small appearance or their looks. What’s bothering me right now is the fact that I saw an image, it was drawn like a portrait by someone on google images of a child in a bathing suit exposing their breasts. When I saw the image I wasn’t even that shocked, I said “What the hell? Why is this child naked?” It looked realistic and everything. But the thing that’s bothering me is the fact that I got an erection to the image, I’d even say that I liked the image. While I’m typing this right now I’m kinda aroused by the thought of it.

I’m upset by this I know that, but I’m not as upset as I should be, what if I’m realizing at my young age that I’m a pedophile? Whenever I’m watching TV and an ad comes on and it’s a child I’m going to start paying attention to the ad and questioning if I like it. I saw my therapist like three days ago and asked her questions about OCD. And she said she doesn’t think I have OCD but instead anxiety and paranoia. (When I’m in school I’m very paranoid and anxious all the time.) I feel like if I don’t pay attention to my groin area when I’m near a beautiful child I might get aroused. I didn’t worry about this type of thing in middle school. I even think I have something called HOCD- fear of being gay. I’m mentioning this one because I think their usually linked together sometimes. I hope I realize that I’m not a pedophile and this is just POCD. I know I like runty, cute girls my age, I even like girls with a big ass and big boobs. I’m just doubting that I have OCD or POCD, and this is just pedophilia. It’s really scary. I’ve been telling myself though that I’m not a pedophile and these are just thoughts, but I still feel like shit. No matter what people tell me I’m going to feel like crap. I sometimes imagine myself with a child to think what I would do, and I’ve imagined myself doing sexual things to them.

I know that I have OCD and Depression, I know that it affects all parts of my life, but I also know that I have what seems to be some slight emotional trauma as a result of my time with religion. On paper, being an Atheist solves the scariest stuff, but life is a near-constant struggle to convince myself that this thing or that thing or that other thing don't prove christianity to be true.

Religion is different for everybody, but for me, the bad of christianity far outweighed the good. I spent at least two years petrified that people I loved might be in hell or going to hell. At that time, I was driven to prove christianity true because I wanted to go to heaven, and now I'm driven to prove it false because I'm terrified of the consequences if it's all real. My stupid fucking disorder pokes holes through every bit of evidence or arguments I find, and some days it genuinely feels like christianity is true and that my loved ones and I are in eternal danger.

My therapist's response seems to be to completely avoid engaging with it at all, so that we can set up exposure stuff. We did exposure stuff for a while, I spent half a year doing things like ""praying to the devil"" or ""imagining myself and my loved ones in hell."" I honestly don't think it helped at all. 

While her advice makes sense, I feel as though my brain is probably a little mixed up from all the christian research I had done over the years. Learning things like ""he who is without sin cast the first stone"" being known to be a later addition to the bible, it makes me wonder just how much I have in my head that isn't accurate. 

So I think ""maybe I should learn about the history of the bible from a non-biased source."" To clear things up and maybe show me some information that will prove to me, once and for all, that it's not real and nothing to be afraid of.

Yet that goes completely against the advice of the therapist. I'm not supposed to research. 

And yet, 6 months of exposure therapy didn't do anything.

I'm preparing to move (long story) and I'm gonna be sticking with her via video call or whatever, but I'm also starting to wonder if maybe she's just not equipped to handle my unique circumstances.

I have been suffering from OCD for a few years now (27, female).. it kind of gets worst sometimes and better sometimes, but it  feels like it's been quite bad in the last few months. no one knows (my family notices things but does not understand and just thinks i'm spoiled and annoying, probably) besides my husband, which has been very supportive and understanding and doing his best to help. 

Recently I have reached a point where I really think I can't deal with this alone and need therapy. I've also very recently started sharing with my husband all the information I found on OCD, and how it's a real problem and it will only get worst if I don't do anything about it.

He thinks I don't need therapy and I shouldn't categorize myself as the person with mental health issues. He doesn't even like when I say it and he kind of thinks I'm complaining all the time. To be fair - he is the only one I can to talk to about it so I can see how it can get too much. I wouldn't wanna be in his shoes :P 

I tried to explain it's good that I want help and I want to get better. and that it's perfectly normal to have mental health issues. 

He is also the main provider and we move around a lot for his job (we're about to move to east asia) so it will be a bit difficult to find a therapist.. 

I am definitely going to get help (I'm saving money for that purpose) whether he thinks it's right or not, but I just kind of wish he would understand the importance of it. I see it as going to a doctor when you have virus, he does not..

Anyway I guess I would like to hear your thoughts on this.. and also - any suggestions for things like online therapy? or how to get help on a budget... things like that.

t2_3ve51881,"Hey guys! I'm new to posting here but I have to say it's nice to find a community of people who also have OCD. I was diagnosed when I was 12 and the intrusive/repetitive thoughts have tormented me since around 10. The biggest problem that it causes me is around love and romance. Normally I'm fairly good at channeling my obsessions into useful pursuits and self improvement (Diet and exercise, study, work etc) but I have a real problem with girls (I'm a 24 year old guy). When I fall for somebody I tend to fall fast and hard and they are ALL I can think about for weeks/months on end. Obviously it is very off-putting for me to show that side of things so I hide it, I have to calculate every text and conversation so as not to appear overly invested/overly emotional (I also strongly suspect I have Sensory Processing Sensitivity which is low-key hell when combined with OCD). I'm not a weirdo about it, I'm very careful to keep it internal but it is literal mental torture 24/7, waiting for the next text/call etc.

I have never done this before even tho i was diagnosed with it 3 years ago.

I locked the door to my apartment and i clearly remember that i locked it but it only took 2 steps outside to get that feeling in you chest where you are uncertain. So i went back up i checked the lock EXACTLY  12 times for some reason which calmed me for about 5 seconds but that i continued by pulling on the door very aggressively for 10 or so times and than left like it didn't even happen. A common sight for me is when i do my college exam and hand in the paper I always reserve 5 minutes before i give in the exam to check if i signed it with my id and name, ofcourse that almost never works as it still gives me doubts even if i check it 100 times. What works for me is taking the picture of the ""thing"" that the ""voice"" is reminding me about, the picture serves as proof. Even tho i don't even check the picture after it helps me massively just knowing that i have the picture to back my thoughts up.

I hope that I can ask for advice here. So, I am pretty average, 18 year old teenager who lives a life that is indeed stressful but not really that bad. I've been experiencing some really bad thoughts that were sometimes severely limiting my daily life. My thoughts that are most likely intrusive want me to scroll up and down pages, articles or switch internet tabs really fast, pause videos and read comments. These thoughts also forbid me to watch a specific youtube video, or listen to a specific genre of a song or feel specific emotions/think about specific things, touch specific things, say some words, be critical to someone, even sometimes forbidding me to even think critically about someone or step on some places. It is like someone is controlling me through the mind and I have to obey them otherwise I will be punished in the future. When I don't want to get punished I say to myself ''I don't risk'' and that makes me feel better, yes it is weird.

Sometimes I do win and do watch or listen to songs even if these thoughts are making me very uncomfortable, it depends. Sometimes these thoughts are very strong and I can't even touch a laptop or phone without doing the scroll up and down, pausing videos, not even talking about music. Sometimes they aren't very strong, when I am lucky. I don't know if it is OCD, I don't really think that my family has or had problems with mental health, I can't imagine that I have it. It feels so weird to know that you are the only one who can actually have this issue. I had some traumatic experiences in the past, bullying, getting my phone stolen, getting my bike stolen, toxic parenting etc. but I don't think that it caused it, it maybe made it worse because as I can remember I did have some OCD symptoms as a child but never really had such intrusive thoughts.

Hey guys and gals, hope you’re all doing well, I’ve been trying to cross post something from earlier today describing my situation and why my sexuality is in question but at this point I honestly care less about that and just want to know about all y’alls groin responses.

Can anyone relate to that sort of feeling? It’s bizarre as hell and of course my brain is like “well this is probably just what true arousal feels like and you’re in denial blah blah blah” idk it’s just curious that I conflate groin responses from HOCD to organic arousal because they are honestly quite different. Like when I’m “checking”  using porn (haven’t since this morning and don’t plan on using this for proof anymore) I watch gay porn and my groin feels very sensitive but it’s more akin feeling scared or more specifically intimidated? Like if I’m about to fight someone? Or it even just feels like an unwanted touch? And when I watch straight porn I’m greeted with the familiar “heaviness” in my groin and true desire. Idk why my brain then still continues to churn everything thing around the rest of the day but alas...here I am. The feeling I get in my groin when checking for same sex attraction also seems to be felt at other times, when I’m simply reading, or looking at a dog take a shit for fucks sake.

Is HOCD partly just an over awareness of ones genitals? And the anxiety from whatever the trigger may be is just forced into my dick? What a dumbass problem to have hahaha.

t2_3jd05f3g,"I have a big thing about needing my own space/bathroom/privacy. Three weeks ago, there was water damage to my bathroom and I was DEVASTATED. I sobbed for days as workers came in and out tearing everything out. At first they said it would still be usable, then I come home and everything is gone. 

Having my own protected space is SO important to me. I’ve not been able to use public bathrooms or even bathrooms at other people’s houses or work for 3+ years now. 

It’s been 3 weeks and my parents still haven’t had things put back together. This is the start of the fourth week with no end in sight. There’s another bathroom in the house that every time I go in, I bleach it, i carry a caddy of my own soaps and TP with me, I feel like I can’t touch anything, it always feels so horrible being in there...

This has honestly been one of the worst times of my life. I hope someone please understands how this feels to me because it’s so hard to explain to people who don’t have OCD. It’s like the end of the world to me. This has been worst case scenario. Survival mode. But it just keeps going and going and going with no end in sight and I’m starting to break down. How long??? How long until I get my space and privacy and safety back???

It’s all come to a head today, because my parents texted and decided spur of the moment to host a BBQ here tomorrow. I’m devastated because I’ll have to share the bathroom with so many people. 

I don’t know how to explain this. But my thoughts are don’t they understand how awful this experience has been????? I know they think I’m weird and wrong for feeling OCD about this, so they’re like “oh it doesn’t hurt her to share so it’s fine.” BUT THEY DONT UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE?!?! Like this is awful?!?! We have had many fights about this before. I always say why can’t people who don’t care sacrifice a little for
Someone who does care??? If I need privacy, why can’t they use the other bathroom while mine is torn out?? Or why can’t they get it put back together again?? Or why can’t they NOT HOST A BBQ AND INVITE A DOZEN PEOPLE OVER WHEN IM BARELY EVEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS!!!!??????!!

So what's been bugging me lately is the worry that my friends have possibly said bad things about me behind my back. I'm mainly stressed about my best friend, who used to be my girlfriend. We didnt work out but we stayed on good terms when we broke up, but we had a hiatus in which we didnt talk after the breakup. We eventually started talking again and became closer than we were even when we dated. But during this time of no communication, I heard that she and some of her friends got together and had a big 'party' where they all got rid of all of their exes things and were talking bad about all of their ex boyfriends. I think they were all sad and did this to make themselves all feel better. I'm worried that my friend was talking crap about me during this. I know me and her werent friends at the time, but it still worries me that one my best friend could have been saying some nasty things about me. I don't know if she really did, but I can only assume that she probably did at least some. I have a lot of anxiety about my appearance and I worry that she may have called me ugly and a crappy person and actually meant it.

t2_2k5yoho4,"Now hear me out. I want to start ERP on my own as I can't really go to a therapist right now. I have been to McLean's OCDI as well as specialists, read lots of books and online information so I do have a decent idea of what I'm doing. I feel I have nothing to lose by putting in say 2 months of ERP on my own as it's better than just sitting around not making progress with my OCD.

My whole thing is that I'll get weird thoughts, and these weird thoughts will ""contaminate"" whatever I'm doing. It can be a sexual thought, pretty much always about a family member, or an ""immoral"" thought. For example, I recently was reading about Hitler (I'm a history major) and felt like maybe I ""admired"" him. Obviously this upset me. 

The compulsion in this case would be to reread that paragraph without having a feeling of ""admiration."" However, I didn't do that and logged into multiple accounts, including this one, and so they are now ""contaminated"" by me admiring Hitler.

I feel like I should undo the thought, delete those accounts, and THEN start with ERP. If I just go into it, it might be too hard to maintain because the anxiety from the Hitler thing will be too great. I sort of have a hierarchy, like thoughts about sex with my dog would bother me the least, thoughts about sex with a family member would bother me more, and a bad thought about a sex abuse victim or a thought that Hitler is admirable would be at the top of the scale.

I think the idea is something like, If I don't delete these accounts, I'm saying it's acceptable to admire Hitler. It is like the accounts have been stained by the feeling I may have had.

And, just as a side note, I don't admire Hitler at all, I think Nazism is one of the most horrible things that has occured in human history. But what if I did have a fleeting feeling of admiration?

Should I delete the accounts and then agree to stop giving into compulsions, or should I not delete the accounts and then just carry on? I'm worried if I just carry on I'm setting myself up for failure because it will be too hard to resist compulsions, and I don't want bigger, more important things (like writing a story, for instance) to become contaminated by Hitler.",Should I give into a compulsion before starting ERP?,OCD,1,bvt7lg,False

It's helped a lot to get me out of bed and feel a little bit more interested in being out of bed but the one part that I know has been my biggest struggle was my OCD related to perfectionism.

I started baking to distract myself out of my intrusive thoughts but my need for perfection made it very frustrating to enjoy the results, no matter how good or how close to the recipe it got I'd always find a flaw or a difference and it was enough to completely ruin my mood to the point that I ended up not wanting to eat it nor hear other people's compliments because I truly believe they were lying to me because I thought they pitied me.

t2_14e7d1ux,"I'm 21 F, and I'm having some issues that are really starting to affect me and recently I've been thinking about an ""obsessive-compulsive tendency"" diagnosis I got when I was 14, and I'm wondering if it's progressed or manifested itself in other ways? Really, I'm just wondering if I'm blowing things out of proportion or whether anyone who has OCD recognises my symptoms and thinks I should seek help...

So onto the facts/symptoms:

1). I've always been EXTREMELY fussy - I couldn't leave the house/would throw tantrums when I was younger if my sock had a crease in it, or my shirt sleeves were creased when putting on a coat (many other things too). My mum found ways to fix them so that  I was comfortable and would send me on my way.

2). When I developed breasts, I found bras so irritating. Not the feel, it was whether the straps were even, or the centre part of the underwire was exactly centred on my chest. Sometimes my frustration would have me in tears and quite a few times, I ended up taking my bra off under my shirt because I couldn't bear the feeling of it. 

3). I had a difficult time related to some family things in my past when I was around 14, I asked if I could see a therapist and they diagnosed me with Generalised anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The main tendency i had was when i was worried, scared or anxious that something bad was gonna happen, or if i felt like i had ""jinxed"" something, i would touch wood. Not the old charming ""knock on wood"" twice and I'm done, but an incredibly long and non-sensical chant (I won't say exactly what it is, it really is ridiculous). I had to say it perfectly, with even spaced breaths in-between words, if i was touching the wood, my hands had to stay in the exact same position or i'd have to start over. Sometimes i'd have to redo it dozens of times, until i was crying in frustration. 

&amp;#x200B;

As i grew older, i grew out of/worked on some of these tendencies and although they still manifest on occasions, i largely disregarded the OC tendencies diagnosis as i saw my behaviour at 14 as immature and attention seeking and believed it was just a symptom of this. 

However, i have been rediagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder this past year. No surprise there. But i still disregarded the OCD tendencies. Until now, when I started to become concerned with some of my behaviour, specifically surrounding clothes. 

\- i find it INCREDIBLY hard to wear trousers of any sort, because the idea that the seams aren't perfectly centred on my body drives me insane. I'm better at sucking it up now, and I've found some trousers that i can bear, but when i wear them i am anxious/uncomfortable all day. 

\- I'm late almost every single day because i become paralysed when trying to choose clothes to wear. Somedays it's worse, but recently, almost every morning nothing i wear fits right, or looks right or feels right, or is appropriate. I stand to stare at the multiple outfits in the mirror for sometimes 2 hours cumulatively and most days and reduced to self-loathing and frustration and tears. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never considered the above obsessive-compulsive, I'm guessing due to ignorance, until i was reading up about the condition and it listed symptoms like:

\- trouble with decision-making

\- reassurance seeking (another BIG thing i do, i seek reassurance on what i'm wearing with my mum and this often ends in arguments because i get so frustrated, and i am constantly seeking reassurance and validation in my relationship, which drives my bf crazy)

\- i've already been working on my anxiety, specifically relationship related. I get very anxious and have obsessive and intrusive thoughts, seek validation and feel temporary relief then get anxious that my bf will get annoyed with my validation seeking and then it all starts over again. I've read of similar thought patterns in people with OCD.

Everyday in my life I have to constantly touch things when I walk around, stop in place, walk backwards, and I look crazy doing it.

But I know that's not the case, and I should not be thinking this way, but I really can't break out. I have to constantly do a ""straight check"", where I'll think of a girl and build up extreme stress in the process, and if I don't get aroused then my brain assumes that I am just entirely gay. I really don't want this to destroy any potential romantic relationship I may have with someone, and I feel like it is going down that pathway. I would really like to try and solve this on my own without the help of doctors, but I feel like I may need to turn to them. It's not that I don't hate them or anything, I'm just not in a position right now to really receive good mental health care due to the care provided where I am living.

The purpose of this post is just to share an interesting read, and not to encourage people to go out and take mushrooms. I don’t want to encourage someone to go to something that could have a bad outcome for them. I’m mostly just fascinated about how this could be an effective treatment method.

The part I could relate with OCD and taking mushrooms is the concept of Letting Go. After consuming them, I recall having anticipatory anxiety about the trip. But once you start to trip, you have to let go and give in to the experience. I think there’s something there as it relates to OCD - Letting Go.

t2_2myqwc8h,"I want to know, if true randomness exists (there is also a sxperdeterminism interpretation of quantum mechanics the opposite of true randomness) in our universe, i.e. if you would rewind time and would not touch anything there would be a different outcome. However, if superdeterminism would be true, the same would happen again if you rewind time and we just label something as 'random' because we can not determine or know the previous causes and that the first cause was the Big Bang. 

However, I always imagine that the universe came from true randomness and that true randomness still exists behind all deterministic patterns and that completely deterministic and mechanic processes are a special case of randomness, where the probability of a certain thing happening is always 100 percent or nearly 100 percent if you repeat the experiment. 

However, true randomness can not be proven and sxperdeterminism not either. However, the universe only makes sense to me if true randomness exists. A holistic universe seems to me that we do not have free choices, or give me the feeling that everything has hidden causes. However I think that for example getting cancer can be truly random (i.e. a random mistake of a certain DNA of a cell copying itself. 

if a think of superdeterminism I always get an anxious feeling and I can not understand how some people like Einstein or Gerard 't Hooft can believe in such think or think it is true and feel good with it. If I imagine this I always feel caught by the '(pre)determined laws of physics' and eliminates my feeling that I have could done otherwise in the past.

Recently I haven’t been able to stop thinking about how unprepared I feel for the real world. I’m going to be a senior in college next year, but I haven’t held a paying job in a while. I’ve worked every summer, but usually only a few days a week and sometimes not even paid (like internships). Everyone I’ve worked for has said I’m a very hard worker and that I never slack off, but I feel like I’ve never done enough for myself. 

My parents have helped me pay for my college (a lot) and are currently paying my rent at school, though the plan is for me to help pay for it when I can get a job. I’ve been applying for jobs but I haven’t heard back from any of them yet so I’m getting scared. I don’t want people to think I’m an ungrateful kid who gets everything from their parents but I feel like a worthless member of society. I see people rant about people like me all the time. I don’t want to be seen as a useless lazy person but I always find myself just spending my time on my computer or in my room.

Unfortunately, she ended the relationship last week after 10 visits because she is studying for a certification that will take her out of the therapy field.  I'm starting over with a new therapist this week.

  
I identify as a food addict -- I engage in emotional eating and sometimes what I feel is compulsive eating, but I don't go on binges.   I also keep getting obsessed with the same topics.  I get intrusive thoughts about many of these topics whenever I am stressed out or feel lonely.  My main obsessions are the Catholic church, Islam, Mormonism, and circumcision.   Sometimes I will chant Mormon phrases like ""Pay Lay El"" or I will chant ""Allah hu akbar"" and make a motion of a finger across the throat.   I am part of neither religion.   I also do things like stick up both middle fingers and curse people out that I am angry with.  When I think I am bad or evil, I will chant ""Luciferian by design"" (speaking of myself).    I do none of these things around other people (99% of the time.   On rare occasions there are outbursts).  Sometimes I really feel like I am really delving into psychosis but that may not be a proper term.  Usually these ""spells"" don't last more than 30 minutes or 1 hour.  They are intense and I feel like I am out of control.  When I am around people and feel wanted or loved, it is good medicine for my soul.  

  
I really want to understand all of this more and get better.  In the past week, I have started drinking caffeinated drinks again and I have noticed the obsessions getting worse.

If it's something obviously dumb, like ""God wants you to go touch that doorknob right now"" (for example), it's not too hard to just overcome it, but every time I resist a more... plausibly-God-inspired thought (like ""God doesn't want you to do x"", even when I can't find anything sinful about x), I worry that I'm actually resisting the Holy Spirit. I have had what I would call urgings of the Holy Spirit in the past that didn't seem like OCD and actually made sense and worked out, but when confronted with a thought that could go either way, I really can't tell the difference.

My current trajectory is just trying to do what I know the Bible says and ignoring most of what my mind says unless it makes sense Biblically, but I'm still worried that I'm resisting the Spirit, and I'm worried that I'm resisting my thoughts because I just don't want to listen to God instead of because I really want to defeat my OCD, and etc. etc. Also, simply trying to follow what has been clearly laid out in the Bible carries its own minefield- I could always be doing more, right? Aren't we supposed to be helping the poor and making disciples? Why do I even do anything besides that? Why am I watching a movie when I could be living in Africa and feeding the hungry or something? etc., etc.

So, uh, I dunno what to do about that. I'm praying about it, of course, but it feels like I'm flying blind as far as following God's will, so I guess I just have to have faith that God is in control of the figurative plane.

I have tried two SSRI's but I really struggled with side effects, but my therapist said I did not take them to ""therapeutic dosage"" since that can be higher with OCD.

t2_41bewqkp,"    My boyfriend (21M) and I (19 F) have been dating for a little over 3 years. Recently (about 2 mo ago) he was diagnosed with severe OCD. His OCD is taking a huge toll on him, me, and our relationship as a whole. He cannot perform daily tasks anymore without having a panic attack or just becoming extremely irritable, such as doing laundry, dishes, making food, going out, pretty much everything. He has started hating doing the things hes always loved. He had to leave his job because it became too much and he was having breakdowns every time he was there. He washes his hands upwards of 100 times a day and cleans items profusely. We are often late to things because his rituals of cleaning and handwashing can take hours. It had made me hate nights because he must clean things and wash his hands perfectly in order to sleep.
He lives with me in my parents house because his parents place is disgusting because his mom is a hoarder. His OCD cannot take being in that house for more than a few hours, if that. He has never been the type of person to yell at me and scold me but now times have changed. When his OCD makes him irritable, he snaps at me for almost anything I suggest or say. He will get mad at me if I accidentaly touch something that he sees as ""dirty"" or if I put one of his items somewhere that is ""dirty"". This has made me fear touching anything in the house really, I feel as if I have to ask permission first. He doesn't want to have sex anymore because he is scared of getting dirty. I am a very touchy feely person and he was too before the diagnosis. I always want to hug and kiss and cuddle but now those things are rare because he often doesnt feel comfortable with being touched. This hurts me greatly because I feel like I need that in a relationship and I'm so used to being able to do it with him. He knows he's hurting me but he just cant seem to stop. 

I have a part time job and whenever I have to leave for it he has a breakdown and suffers the whole time I'm there because he says it's hard for him to be alone. This puts immense pressure on me to always be home and cater to his needs instead of mine. I have been avoiding doing things that I actually enjoy because I'm helping him through panic attacks and helping do the rituals. I feel like I am constantly comforting him and helping him come out of a panic attack. I have an anxiety disorder myself, and when he is in an attack mine shoots through the roof but I do my best to ignore it in order to give my attention to him.

Whenever I try and Express how I am feeling to him, he just gets mad and says that he can't control how his OCD works, and I understand that, but it doesnt mean that I can't suffer. He revealed to me that when he knows he hurts me he has suicidal thoughts. We had a super super good relationship before this diagnosis. We never once fought in 3 years other than normal disagreements, we had an amazing time with eachother always. 

My boyfriend knows that his OCD is destroying his life, but he knows it's out of his control. He is a very good person, but OCD has made him into somone else. He goes to therapy every two weeks and sees a psychiatrist once a month. But it isnt enough. He is on his second medication but nothing has changed, actually things have become worse. Recently we went to the hospital because he was having thoughts of suicide and things became too much. The hospital mistreated him and did not decide to admit him. The only other option I can think of is going to an impatient mental heath unit or a residential facility, but we would have to travel at least 2 hours and it would be extremely expensive. I am just not sure what to do in my situation. I miss the little things he used to do like kiss my forehead, grab my butt playfully, hug me from behind, the cute little things. I can feel him not listening when I talk more and more because he is worried about other things.

 I feel trapped in a way because though I still really love him I am not happy. He doesnt really have any friends so I am his only support system. He has no where to go, his house is basically inhabitable to him and he doesnt have any other family around. And he says he needs me. I believe in him getting better and I want to be there for it, but the process is taking a big toll on my mental health. I love him so fucking much and I want him to get well and become closer to his normal self. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do as a partner or options to help him get better please let me know.

t2_2kkgtlw1,"Ok, so recently, I managed to fully decelop OCD. I’ve always seemed to have symptoms, but only recently did they really begin to really become more numerous and more noticeable, most likely due to the development of other anxiety disorders and depression that occurred a few years back. When I really began thinking that some of the things I was experiencing was OCD, I explained it to my mom but she basically just brushed over it and acted like it was nothing and just told me that it was my inner perfectionist. Later when I was actually diagnosed, I really hoped for some more support, however, it’s like no one in my family actually believes the diagnosis. They’re always judging me for my symptoms, especially the noticeable compulsions. I go to wash my hands for the fifth time in the row and there they are telling me how it’s unnecessary and how not everything is dirty and how it’s technically bad for me. Like yes, I already know that, you can leave your grievances at my OCDs doorstep but I guarantee they won’t open that door. When I freak out over people getting in my personal space and politely begin asking people to move, suddenly I’m the bad guy. How dare I ask my younger sister to move. Even if they have pretty much as much space to move around as they want, suddenly they’re the victims and I’m left to have a panic attack. There was another recent situation where I went to a local ice cream shop and a random guy accidentally picked up my order instead. He didn’t eat out of it or anything, but just him putting his hand on my flurry cup just set me off for some reason. Then later when my dad found out about my situation, he decided to inform me on the fact that everyone working there had already touched the cup so I had no need to freak out and end up hyperventilating and crying like I did when I got home after a series of triggering events (i.e. ice cream making my hands and everything really sticky, dropping my ice cream and having it splatter all over everything, sitting way too close to random people, etc.). Like wow, I had no idea that the workers had to touch my order. Fascinating. Do tell me more. But yeah, that alone is all just so frustrating. Then there’s my sister. Since I’m the oldest child, she has that tendency to try and do everything like me. However, she recently took it way too far. She doesn’t necessarily know I have OCD since she’s only 10 and I don’t need her knowing all that, but she knows I have triggers that will set me off. However, she decided that she wanted to COPY MY TRIGGERS AND REACTIONS. Now before you say that maybe she too has OCD, I want to point out that every time she does it, she tries to point it out to me and the people around her. “Oh I REALLY didn’t like that sticky feeling so I better go wash my hands.” “Eww Wolfumus, she just touched my food and gave it back to me, can you believe her? That’s so gross!” “Did you see that Wolfumus? She didn’t wash her hands! She’s going to spread germs all over!” “Move please, you’re getting too far into my personal space. Wolfumus, I know you know how that feels so could you ask them to move?” It just annoys me so much.

t2_bsd0t,"   Hey everybody. I hope this is an appropriate place to open up and that I’m following the rules. I’m tired of always being afraid of a worst case scenario when I should be able to move on from a simple task without treating everything like a potential tragedy or life changing moment. Why can’t I just function like everybody else and not have to worry about all these exaggerated dangers? I never processed fear or anxiety in a healthy way, but it wasn’t until a couple of classmates passed away in grade school that I started developing these rituals. It started with scripted prayer, and I’m not even overly religious. Now I’m checking outlets, faucets, locks, door latches, the garage door, car windows, parking parking brake and even gear stick, the refrigerator door, the stove, and anything else that could go wrong. 

   It’s constant, and takes priority over any rational thing I need to do. I know it’s completely irrational and intrusive, and I tell people I know that I do realize it’s ridiculous. Ridiculous or not, I feel I have to keep checking over and over again. I’m in my mid twenties now, and there has been periods of my life since high school where I was afraid to leave the house because I was convinced that as soon as I left something would happen and be my fault. I have a great job now that I like doing, (I work with kids with autism) but it’s still so hard for me to buckle down and leave in the morning. If I’m the last one to leave the house I feel like it’s all on me to keep the house from burning down or flooding or who knows what else. I’m tired of planning around my compulsive rituals. I want to be able to open the fridge or use the sink once my roommates have gone to bed without staying up until the early hours to continually check that everything is okay. Once I see that everything is off and still, I want it to register in my brain that it’s all good. It never does though. 

   I’m grateful and I know that the job I recently started and the place I live now is what I’ve wanted so badly for years, I just wish I could see it without the monkey on my back. I see my friends go to bed in peace with the same things that I can’t stop thinking about.

t2_3afcwww3,"Hi! I’m an edgy high schooler n all that jazz but recently I’ve been thinking a lot about a “phase” I went through when I was in fourth grade, so at about 9 or 10 years of age. I’m not even completely sure that it’s even a thing that’s related to OCD but it’s 4am and I’ve just found that this subreddit exists and I think it’s the best place to post about it since I don’t really know anyone I can relate to. Sorry for the tangent, anyways, to the point.

I was about 9 when it all started and it was basically just this obsession with keeping myself away from “dirty” things, especially my hands. It slowly progressed and got pretty bad. I was basically a hardcore germaphobe. I would wash my hands multiple times if I even though I had touched something “not sanitary”. My hands became really dry and cracked and I would often go into anxious spirals about that because it meant germs and stuff could get into my cracked hands and get to me faster or something. I had to bring lotion to school but at times lotion wasn’t even sanitary enough for me. I remember having a huge breakdown over it as a small nine year old as we were switching classes and I had to be calmed down by my teacher because I was crying hysterically over germs and my hands and just how anxious I felt. 

The point I realized I needed to change was when someone accidentally spit on my lip while they were talking to me and I had a full on breakdown. I went to my room and cradled myself with my knees tucked in and I basically went into a spiral that told me it was inevitable I would die because this girl had spit on me. I’m glad that I realized the broken logic in that and I stopped behaving like that. 

Even though I stopped being that bad I recently realized that I still do that stuff subconsciously without realizing it. Our kitchen sink got clogged a few weeks ago and all of the water was filling the sink and it was this gross muddy tinted stuff with gross things floating in it and even after my mom thoroughly cleaned the sink and the area around it I still don’t think I could let myself touch it. I didn’t even walk near it for a few days. I’ll use the sink but I will not touch the inside of it. Now I’m also feeling concerned because our dishes get washed there and now I feel kinda scared to use them. I’m like this with other stuff too but I never pinpointed it to me being instinctively germaphobic. It just kind of erks me that after all this time I haven’t really gotten rid of my old behavior and it scares me that I’ll go obsessive again. I have enough mental issues as is, I don’t want more on top of it. 

I just wanted to know if anyone who maybe has some sort of experience with this kinda stuff could somehow help me or give me advice on if this is normal or not. If not, telling someone- even if the are strangers- provides a little bit of relief to me.",I’m probably being dumb,OCD,1,c872zs,False
t2_42aexkoq,"I'm so relieved. I've lurked here for a long time and just now made an account to share this. I think I'm finally over my very first obsession. I've had many over the years but that particular one, my very first one, really clung to me because I spent so much time with it undiagnosed, not having any clue of what was happening to me. It was the most terrifying time of my life.


It was a pure O obsession. And obviously, I never found the clear answer to it that my brain always wanted me to find. But it doesn't matter to me anymore. My life over the years is finally proof enough to me that it doesn't matter if it's real or not. I hardly ever think about that obsession anymore, and when I do, I can dismiss it without any complusions.


I can't believe I actually made it here. In the midst of the worst of it, I didn't see a way out. I was severely depressed and suicidal and it was ruining everything for me. I spent every day paralyzed with anxiety. I thought I'd have to live in guilt and shame about this for the rest of my life, but now I know I don't. And let me tell you, it doesn't  happen overnight. It took two years of actively battling with this for me to be able to say that I'm truly over it. But I'm here.


Unfortunately I'm still pretty miserable with my other current obsessions. I wish it was easy to just apply the same mindset to them. But no, every single obsession has to be tackled individually.


However, this small victory has given me the tiny bit of relief I've been needing all this time. I feel like my OCD constantly has me by my throat and I've gotten a few moments to just breathe and live life the way I did before this obsession struck.

Hello world! (sorry)

I have been struggling with OCD and scrupulosity for many months now. I have likely had OCD for years, since childhood, but have only recently been diagnosed by a medical professional (and so it isn't the usual ""oh, you must be really neat and tidy!"" formulation of ""OCD"" seen in media and movies; rather it's the kind that is characterised by an anxiety disorder and is completely debilitating).

Part of me just needs to get this out there somehow.

My personal OCD (it differs from individual to individual) is marked by religious compulsions. I'm Jewish, and we have three prayer cycles, morning, afternoon, and evening. I routinely spend several hours a day in prayer (when it was really bad I could spend up to 5-6 hours just trying to complete the morning prayers). I've been working with a psychologist and have rules derived from a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach to try and deal with these issues, but long story short, it isn't working.

The psychologist (and my Rabbi) are using CBT in the form of time-based rules on the prayers - e.g. only a hour for morning prayers, however far I manage to get, I get. I can't seem to stick to these rules.

Specifically, my compulsions require me to say the prayers perfectly, no mispronunciations, thinking about the meaning of the prayers, avoiding intrusive thoughts, etc. Everything I read about Jewish laws as regards prayer talks about the importance of properly pronouncing prayers, order, intention, etc. So I end up in a cycle where I can literally spend half an hour saying one paragraph. It then ends up obviously affecting the CBT rules discussed above. Then I can't stick to the rules because I haven't even done a ""bare minimum"", even though this is exactly the situation the CBT is intended to produce (and treat).

So I am writing this, partly as a vent because I really just don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to accept that the rules regarding what prayers must be said and how they should be said may not be possible for me because the more I try and follow them, the less able I am to do \*anything\* once the OCD and anxiety kick in.

I'm trying to convince myself the treatment prescribed is a way of getting control of my mental issues, and have a more positive relationship with the prayers. So eventually I can do more, and better. But the ingrained habits coupled with long history of being told the importance of exact adherence to the rules of prayer are, at this point, almost insurmountable.

As an aside, I am working with my rabbi. He was the one supporting both the notion of time-based rules treatment, as well as ignoring mispronunciations. I just can't seem to get myself out of the OCD habits of \*having\* to follow the prescriptions on pronunciation, saying full prayers, etc. It's a complex issue but my life is falling apart, as you can imagine.

My stress and anxiety levels are so high that neither I nor my wife can deal with them anymore.

As another aside, my OCD is not merely scrupulous in nature. That's one manifestation, there are others including cleanliness and other issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 19 year old guy from the Netherlands and 3 months ago I've been diagnosed with OCD. It was usually just about checking doors if they're closed or not so I thought it was not that bad. Not until I got my drivers license in March.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember the first day I sat alone in the car. I wasn't enjoying it. It was absolute hell. I always had the constant fear that I hit someone and I didnt notice. This is the beginning of it, I never thought I would feel this way as I always enjoyed driving with my instructor so much. Eventually these feelings became less, but I never ever sat in the car without fear of having an accident. People call me a good driver but my head says that I am a bad driver.

&amp;#x200B;

A little over a month ago, the worst happened: I got a panic attack while driving. I was at a parking lot backing out. There was a volvo next to me who was about to back out too but he waited for me to drive away. I drove a little forward and it looked like I hit the volvo. The volvo bumped a bit forward. I was driving away slowly and the volvo was backing out as if nothing happened (Nothing happened too.). Later I found out that modern cars have automatic brakes when backing out  so thats what caused the effect of me thinking that I hit the car (I felt nothing in my own car).  When I got home that day I had a panic attack and I thought the worst: The guy noted down my license plate and the police will come after me. My dad tried to calm me down but it was near impossible, my entire day was fucked. Few days after that I managed to calm down. No visible damage on my car.

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks later something similar happened, but the feeling was much much worse. I went to a restaurant with my friend. As we all left, I got in my car and was backing out again. The exhaust hit a stone so I heard a loud bang. I knew at that point that nothing happened, so I stayed calm. When I was on my way home I saw a shit ton of ambulance and police cars driving so thats where I started to freak out again. I thought again that I hit someone while I didnt notice but the rational part of me knew that this is not possible, but the ""OCD"" part of me just made it so much worse than it actually is.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not avoid driving as I need to use my car few times a week but I am not enjoying it either as I am constantly with fear behind the wheel and I am sick of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do at this point.

Often, it’s images that surface a lot of shame and guilt and embarrassment. I would tell my partner to stop but I usually want to keep going and try to focus on the tangible and physical. It’s super easy to get into your head especially during sex.

t2_13ywf5,"*I’m writing this to see if anyone can relate/has advice. It’s also sort of to vent until I can see my therapist again*

**Context:**

I’m 17 years old and have been diagnosed with OCD for the last couple of years. Originally, it was thought to be just pure-o with mainly violent thoughts (I’m gonna hurt someone, I’m a menace to society, etc.) But everyday I’m learning that things I consider “normal” are actually OCD related, and I’m learning that OCD is at this point my entire life.

**What I’m facing right now:**

I’ve always questioned my sexuality, ever since fifth grade. I’m a male, and have believed that I’ve had attraction to other males in some shape or form. It’s always changing, I either have the sudden realization that I’m gay, and go a while like that but then I slowly move back to liking women (it’s more complex, but that’s a good way to put it in short). I’ve always been obsessed with figuring out my sexuality, but I never thought it could be OCD related until I browsed the OCD Foundation website and saw that obsessing over sexuality is a thing.

This has just torn me apart. It makes sense that it’s just an obsession, but how am I supposed to truly figure out my sexuality if it’s all an obsession? 

What is even truly really me? Logically I know this is a dumb question, but it’s still tearing my apart. Is everything I question just an obsession?

t2_2s7eki9f,"2 years ago I was certain this was POCD. It started when I got the random intrusive thought “could I be a pedofile?”, of course the answer was no but I needed 100% proof, had a major panic attack, started checking my groin for signs of arousal, blah blah blah you get the jist I was the stereotypical POCD victim. However now it’s almost indistinguishable from pedophilia.

It got bad when I saw this kid in a movie and thought “oh he looks good” then freaked out. What’s worse is that I got a groinal response from this and mistook what I believe was anxiety for signs of arousal. Typical of OCD sufferers, I started obsessing about this question “what if I have a crush on this boy” and began testing for groinal responses. Naturally they got more intense to the point where I started masturbating to the groinal responses because I felt like that was the only way to make them go away. 

They became more intense developing into now being full on erections. My obsessions with OCD have come and gone. Usually they shift whenever my POCD switches from one child to another, and once they’ve switched I never have any symptoms from the previous subjects. This is different though because I genuinely thinks this kid looks good but not in a sexual way at all I just think he has a nice face. It’s the same way as me appreciating a same sex guy’s beauty without wanting to fuck him. But these erections are almost immediate now, I’ve programmed my brain to be into this, and now the arousal won’t go away. Lately I’ve gone a week of trying not to test in my head for arousal and committing compulsions and usually my true heterosexual sexuality starts to return. But then whenever I test again I always begin to get an erection. I had a recent episode when I was masturbating to porn when I got the thought “this probably wouldn’t be as good as masturbating to that kid” and lo and behold I got more aroused at that moment and finished to him because at this point, I really don’t fucking care. I don’t want to do anything sexual with this kid because I find nothing sexual about him, but this arousal is too strong and I can’t escape.

The thing is this kid is only 3 years you ger than me which medically woouldn’t make me a pedofile. He’d be a high school freshman, and at school I never pay attention to freshmen nor have I ever had a crush on one except for when I was one. I’ve also had a bunch of relationships throughout my POCD theme and they were all great. I’ve also never been the guy to get aroused super easily by girls, apart from porn, usually I have to get to know them first or make some sort of physical contact with them to be really aroused; and then once I’m in a relationship with a girl I get aroused like instantly when I start thinking of them. There are some days though when my 17 year old labido is in overdrive and I get aroused more frequently but usually I’m pretty chill.

So given this information is it even paying attention to any of this? Even if I were genuinely sexually attracted to this kid, it’s only ONE kid and I’m still sexually attracted to girls. My meds also make it really hard to tell if this is OCD because they have drastically reduced the frequency of intrusive thoughts so my POCD is only triggered by testing on this kid. The cycle usually goes: check for arousal by bringing up an image in my head, get a groinal response along with other arousal symptoms, freak out, and if I go to check my groin I may end up just masturbating.

I had childhood OCDs of handwashing and the superstition of not stepping on sidewalk cracks. I also had strange magical ideas like if the phone doesn't ring in the next 30 minutes my mother will die.

However, one of the biggest ways that OCD has impacted my life is in sexuality. Since 8 years old I have had intrusive thoughts of humiliating myself. It wasn't all the time but I would go through phases of being aroused by some form of humiliation. For example, at age 9 there was a few months when I was going to the bathroom in the front yard getting excited by the idea that people were watching me. It continued until my older sister came home from school one day and said that boys in her grade were asking her why her brother went to the bathroom outside like a dog. I tried to deny I had been doing that, but I knew I had been caught and had to stop. Although admittedly I felt an erotic urge to keep doing it.

At age 13 I invented a game to play alone in my bedroom of roleplaying that I was being held hostage by a criminal gang who had tied me up. I would put my arms behind my back and pretend to be helpless as I struggled against the imaginary ropes. This was very arousing for me.

Toward the end of my teen years I developed HOCD (I didn't know that's what it was called at the time). I had to stop watching baseball games because of the obsession I had of staring at the butts of the players. I knew I wasn't gay, but I could not stop looking at them like that.

Most of my sexual dreams involve humiliation: usually exhibitionism (sph) or crossdressing.

I read a lot about sexual fetishes but I can't clearly distinguish in my mind the difference between a sexual fetish and an OCD like HOCD, POCD, or TOCD.

Did some research. Came across CBT. Seems like a great start and no medication required (I'd really like to avoid the use of mind altering drug), the only problem is I can't seem to find any CBT therapist/specialist anywhere where I live. (tiny country, central EU)

I'll obviously keep on looking and will ask around more. But in the meantime, I was told by a GP that cbd oil could help if I'm willing to put in the effort as far as fighting the compulsion goes.

He said it takes a few weeks to kick in so he also gave me Haldol that would give me a quicker relief. I'll be on 1mg for a few weeks. It's an antipsychotic medicine, but I've never heard of it so I am nervous.

t2_2pa1bw0s,"Recently I've been caught in an endless OCD feedback loop — one that consists of evaluating, and then invariably denigrating, my intelligence level. It's getting more than tiresome. It's starting to shake my basic faith in myself as an individual. 

The root of the problem: I'm a humanities student. I've always been a gifted reader and analytical writer; in academic settings, I've casually excelled at extracting ideas from texts and structuring my own in kind. Recently, though, I've become convinced that my non-participation in STEMdom evidences some kind of (heretofore thinly concealed) cognitive defect. 

I can't program and I've never tried to learn. I wouldn't know my way around a difficult physics problem. While I'm quick with verbal logic, symbolic language, unfamiliar as it is, intimidates me. Every time I hear about some simple but pivotal scientific insight, I torture myself with counterfactual history: would I — had I been transplanted to the era of its original formulation —  have dreamed it up myself? If not, I must be a step from idiocy, after all. 

And so goes the self-flagellation. 

The more I think about how little I've engaged with these disciplines, the less worth I see in the depth of my engagement with my own. So what? I can look at some artifacts or texts, find some reasonably complex patterns across them, and write a cohesive essay testifying to their interrelation. But, left to my own devices, could I have come up with something as cleanly ingenious as, say, Foucault's pendulum? Do I have the ability to comprehend, much less actively problem-solve or produce, a multi-tiered math proof? Could I develop a novel algorithm to do a relatively simple task and calculate its efficiency?

The answer to these questions haunts me. To ward it off, I've been on a compulsive kick lately that has only further abraded my already threadbare self-worth. It's consisted of wrestling with IMO problems, sparring with technical papers on things like continuum mechanics and model theory, watching all kinds of youtube errata on coding challenges... that is, providing myself with ""tests"" and ""checks"" that, you guessed it, leave me feeling all the more frustrated. Recently, I went through every TED-ed riddle — as well as countless ""quant interview""-type problems — and become abjectly miserable whenever I couldn't get one. (In a cruel asymmetry, getting many right, reasonably quickly, didn't make me feel any better at all.) 

Meanwhile, it's become functionally impossible for me to enjoy the company of others. All I can focus on is making comparative assessments of our intelligence levels, which has set even the most benign — and kind — interactions to a perversely competitive score. I can barely focus on my own academic work because I've so thoroughly discounted it. I fear that my performance is faltering as a result — which, of course, confirms the anxiety by completing the feedback loop! That means I can't even do the thing, however remedial, that I'm ostensibly *good at.* And so on, ad infinitum. I'm wondering if any one can relate or commiserate.",Intelligence obsession,OCD,1,ckvijo,False

t2_shvrxfh,"So, it all started tonight when I wanted a snack. Asked my dad if we could open this bag of rice cakes he had. He reluctantly said yes, and so I eagerly grabbed the bag out of the cabinet. As I’m about to open it, though, I can feel there is air already coming out of it. I inspect the bag only to find that it is open partly (a few inches) along the back seal. This stresses me out, as I automatically think that they must’ve been tampered with and poisoned. I tell my dad they were already open, and he says to just throw them in our kitchen trash can. Which should’ve been good enough, but not when you have ridiculous tendencies to obsess. 

And so I thought, “well I can’t keep those rice cakes in the house, because what if I purposefully eat one later and then I will be poisoned and die”. My mind likes to trick me into thinking I will self-sabotage myself, so I start to panic a bit, unsure if I will be able to stand the “temptation” of having poisoned rice cakes in my house that I might impulsively eat at any moment. So I tell my dad we should throw the rice cakes in the outside trash, which happens to be a mini dumpster as we live at a small apartment complex. My dad replies that sure, I can go throw them out if I want. 

But this makes me panic too, because I “hate” dumpsters due to my paranoid fears that rabid animals like to congregate around dumpsters and I am near-phobic about having a run-in with rabies. So, I’m stuck between not wanting to go to the dumpster to throw out the rice cakes because I will probably be bit by a rabid animal if I go outside but if I don’t throw away the rice cakes tonight then the temptation of eating them will be too great and I will impulsively eat one and poison myself. 

At this point I am getting overwhelmed, and I feel that my dad is catching on to the outlandish-ness of my sudden rice cake fear. I then start having paranoid thoughts that if I don’t throw them out, my dad is going to sabotage me and feed me a rice cake while I sleep or crumble one up in one of our leftover food containers in the fridge so that I will be poisoned. I beg my dad to personally throw out the rice cakes tonight for me (I know, enabling family members is bad) and he eventually and reluctantly agrees. He tells me I have to go out with him to the dumpster though while he throws it away. I figure that this is actually a really good opportunity for some diy “exposure therapy” so I of course agree.

We go out to the dumpster, and he makes me peer inside, which I do and it’s all good. I’m mildly acting compulsive by enabling my own hyperawareness to scan the area around the dumpster to make sure any animals aren’t nearby. Well, the dumpster has these little handle things (I think where the dump truck picks them up at) on its sides and as we are walking away from the dumpster I start wondering if the little side handle on my side of the dumpster maybe had like a bat chilling on it or something and that I had touched it even though I’m almost sure I didn’t even touch the dumpster and even more sure there were no bats around...(I’ve had a preoccupation with finding bats in obscure places for a long time now).

Anyways, I don’t let myself go back to the dumpster, but I keep looking at it as we are walking back to the apartment. We go inside, and I can’t stop thinking about the damn dumpster, wanting to go ultra-compulsive and check the area around the dumpster and the side handle again to make sure there are no animals there. I just hate my brain lmao and I know this story is 1000% so extra but I wrote it completely honestly, including even the most ridiculous thoughts because those ridiculous thoughts are the real me and the way my brain operates.

I had early obsessions and so when puberty came around I was really scared because I wasn’t maturing as fast as the other girls and wanting to date yet, I was a lesbian. My mom and my sister really pushed the agenda that I had to have giant sexual lust for male celebrities and I just felt not into that. I started to feel really weird around other girls and I wouldn’t say it was in a sexual way. I did have weird groin urges but nothing I ever wanted to act on, they felt very much like all my other OCD obsessions. Even writing this now I’m like “denial denial denial” in my head. I can confidently say I’ve never had a giant sexual crush on a woman the way I have with a man.  I never had a woman in my life or otherwise where I just...wanted to be with her in a relationship or have sex with her. Sometimes I see a pretty girl and I feel like oh she’s pretty but I never fantasize about girls. I have been in a relationship with a man for nearly two years, and sometimes I feel like I’m just lying to him because I’m a repressed lesbian because when we have sex, I get nervous (bc of past sexual abuse). When I was little I found my teachers, both male and female, to be comforting. I used to only draw girls when I drew, and used online software to create outfits for girls. I remember getting sexually aroused at sexual things when I was younger but not necessarily like ...oh I wish I could do that...it was like “I can tell this is a sexual adult thing” and so it would excite and arouse me.


I’m just so scared I’ve been lying to myself for 20 years? And that one day I’ll just meet a girl and be sexually attracted to her and it’ll ruin my relationship. I’m just so scared.

t2_4a97q0kq,"Hi, I need an answer about this, sorry For my English I’m not native. I  have what I hope is HOCD over a year now. It all started in a weed trip. When I quitted weed, I recovered for like 5 months where my attraction for guys came back and I was normal again. Then i relapsed on the weed cause I thought I was fine again but thank to this the thoughts came back again and now I feel hopeless.

Anyway, the thing is that this year I cheated on my boyfriend with a GUY that I liked. We had a thing going on this summer and I felt sooooooo excited about it, happy , thrilled about life again ,  for having these affair., that there was no doubt about being a lesbian anymore because I was FEELING very happy, FEELING real excitement, FEELING real needs and desires of fucking the dude, not just THINKING about it. It reminded me of the feelings i had before the HOCD striked.  

We had sex a few times. The first ones were good . Until it stopped because HOCD CAME BACK and all that excitement for the guy was GONE. I swear that I went from feeling a lot to feel nothing for him like a switch when HOCD returned, because the thoughts of liking girls and not being true to myself were more present  in my mind. My mind (or me?!?) was telling me that I was forcing my crush on the guy and that I really wasn’t attracted to him because he’s not a girl. 

So my question is, HOCD is that powerful that can take your feelings away like that? Or am I really gay and really never felt nothing for the guy and I was lying to myself? What were all those real feelings and emotions then? Mere illusions ? Lies? Am I doomed to feel nothing towards anybody but girls?

Unless I’m consciously talking to myself in my head or reminding myself to think of things I hardly ever have any normal thoughts. My mind wanders almost all of the time to think about completely random and incoherent things and it’s until I realise I’m doing it do I stop the train of thought. It’s often music in my head, someones just a certain sentence over and over. For example I just caught myself imagining my family talking about me being over rated, that’s just one of the many weird thoughts I have frequently. I’ve even just imagined shapes spinning around and nothing more. If I feel anxious or something happens it’s natural to think about it over and over  and over again and its like I cant stop the thoughts sometimes. It’s never ‘I need to wash the car’ or ‘Can’t believe that happened before’ or about useful things. I’ve had to purposely make myself think normally and its impossibly difficult to sustain. I don’t know if this is OCD or if somethings wrong with me, which honestly I’m suspecting, or what but any perspective on this would be great.

t2_33j94ux8,"It's pretty common and is in our nature as social creatures to seek out attention. I think I have ocd right now, although never diagnosed, and part of that is because of the symptoms I had earlier in my life, compulsions such as a fear of contamination, and being unable to eat when there are too many objects one one side of the table and less on the other, and intrusive swearing in my head, intrusive thoughts about sexualizing friends and family (even though I'm asexual), and developing an extreme fear of music and certain words. When I think back to my middle school days, I think about my extreme obsession with sympathy and attention, and I'm wondering if that might have been an ocd obsession. This could have been an obsession with suffering or mental health, too. From the few things that I remembered, I remember constantly researching for any mental illnesses I could have, almost on a daily basis. I would research things to self diagnose myself with because I would want go make myself suffer, not as punishment, just because I wanted to suffer. And I really wanted people to perceive me as a broken mental illness- induced child and to feel sorry for me and give me attention. I wanted this very badly. This could have all just happened because I was just a lonely child, but it went a step further when I tried to give myself mental illness. I tried to give myself Autism, only to discover you can inherit it genetically, and was genuinely disappointed by that fact. Then, I tried to give myself ocd, because I thought I already had some of the symptoms I could actually develop it.

So the thing is I am not so sure about my diagnosis. I went to a psychologist when I was 12 or 13, cant really remember. He said that I have OCD and gave me my first pills, Anafranil. After a few months of taking it and going back for regural checkups my sympthoms got better, at least the ones I had problem with originally.

I am 29 now and my OCD went trough so many forms that I can hardly describe it. At first I had problems with food, I would leave pieces of it in case it was poisoned. After that the usual don't step on the crack thing happaned. Then all hell broke loose when I learned about ancient religions with evil or merciless gods. Ever since then my mind kept spewing curse words on them. It was aboiut 4-5 years ago when I got back to another psychologist who still deemed this as OCD and said that I should get back on meds but not Anafrnil this time, as SSRIs ar much better. Then came a rollercoaster ride of emotions and meds. I am on fluvoxamine now, this is the 4th SSRI and I have to take Frontin (Xanax) too to manage my PAnic Disorder wich surfaced a few years ago.

t2_4hqqxxne,"First off, I’m a fourteen year old boy. I’m in my sophomore year of highschool. School starts for me on September 4th I think. I’m also going to be fifteen in September so I’m getting closer to the age a person can actually be considered a pedophile if they are attracted to children. Let me explain my situation. For some odd reason I have three fears. Here’s all of them: fear that I am a pedophile, fear that I am bisexual and fear that I’m transgender. The two that bother me the most are the transgender and pedophile fears. Because I obviously don’t want to be a pedophile who’s attracted to prepubescent children and I also don’t want to be transgender because that means I’d be more comfortable as a girl and that possibility is scary. Being gay I could live with because at least it’s not like having an unhealthy attraction to children or anything like that. It’s just all of these things feel so damn real. It really feels as if I am these things and that really bums me out and has me down all the time. If I really am a pedophile than I’ll do the right thing and get the help I need. I don’t think I want to do anything to children but I’m not to sure. Maybe I do? I’m confused. Maybe it’s making me believe I do. I find children to be quite annoying when they yell. And honestly I wish they would shut the hell up because they disturb my peace and quite in the morning. I don’t hate children though. I mean I want them to be happy and enjoy themselves and have a good time and whatever. Because they are children and I remember what it was like to be young like them. I mean I’m still young I think. But they are clearly younger. I imagine these scenarios that I think I could be in with a child. I do it everyday pretty often to. One of the scenarios was me in a car and a child goes on my lap and I like it in the scenario. It didn’t actually happen, I think I do it to see how I’d feel if it happened. I don’t know why but typing this made me kind of aroused. I’m afraid to admit it. I did imagine it a little to I think. I’m confused. Even if I was a pedophile I wouldn’t act on my desire. I know I wouldn’t. Not sure if I even have a desire or not. I really do feel like one. Even transgender I feel like that’s real to some extent. It doesn’t feel that real right now but it has felt real before. The gay one feels real too. I know I’m not gay but I do fear being bisexual which could be true I don’t know. When I’m horny and want to jack off I don’t think I think about children or babies or some shit. I worry about all of these things everyday. Well not all of them everyday. Most days I focus on just one than others I’ll think about another. I just fear being a pedophile. Am I a pedophile if I like the word prepubescent? Because I just like the word I dunno why. Maybe it’s because I am a pedophile or something. I’m going to sleep now, I just felt like posting this before going to sleep. I just want answers. I feel like I’ll get aroused if I see a child in a bathing suit or something. Im worried I might like undeveloped bodies like actual really young children. I worry I might like a child emotionally and connect with them. Even though non of these things happen. I want to TRUELY understand what it means to be a pedophile. What is it pedophiles like about children. Is it their behavior or their appearance. I don’t know. I want a girl who’s energetic fun has a complete personality unlike me. I want her to be the opposite of me basically. Because opposites attract I guess. I want her to be cute pretty and maybe even sexy. I know this is weird but I’d rather have a pretty cute girl than a girl who’s just sexy. Not sure why. I’d rather look at a girl who’s pretty and cute rather than one who’s just got big boobs, big ass thicc everything. Looks of the girl are important rather than just her body. I don’t even want to get a girlfriend because of this. Because if I turn out to actually be a pedophile than the relationship will obviously not work. There’s no way I can be in a relationship if I’m a pedophile. Nobody would want a pedophile anyway. Even having kids is a no. I think I did want to have kids before but now I don’t. Because well POCD. I don’t want to say I have POCD because I’ve read from this person that people who self diagnose themselves are usually denying it or something so that’s why I won’t say I have it. I really want to take a test that’s attached to my dingaling or my brain or whatever to see if I genuinely want to have sex with a undeveloped child or something. I probably can’t because I’m not old enough. I just want to know if I’m a pedo or not. That’s it. Lots of people with POCD know they are not pedophiles deep down but I’m not sure if I am. It feels like I really am. My case seems different from other people’s. Like I don’t get intrusive sexual thoughts of children. I don’t get those at all. Maybe I do I don’t think I do though. I’m just so unsure. I think there’s actually a test out their that can give me the answer I’m looking for. I’ve read about a guy who found out he was a pedo because he took this test in therapy I think. And it turned out he really did want to do something sexual to the child. I feel like if I took that test then I’m gonna find out I really do want to do something to the child. I could be overthinking I don’t know. I want to take that test but I’m also afraid it’s going to say I’m a pedophile. I just want a solid answer, and that seems like the best way to find out. Through an actual test that can see my excitement levels or whatever. I never worried about this before until something triggered it. I do have an idea of what triggered it but I don’t feel like writing this anymore because I’m tired. Also I don’t mind honest answers with this. If it sounds like pedophilia than okay it might be pedophila. This shit bothers me so much. Any response on what this could be is very appreciated. I heard from someone it can be different for every sufferer from this. And stuff like that. Sometimes I wonder if I even have ocd even though I show signs of it with my cell phone. I constantly factory reset my iPhone. I try making it as perfect as it can but I wind up rebooting it all the time. I think I’ve rebooted this same phone maybe like 30 40 45 times? Maybe even more than that. I might be gassing it a little. But I have rebooted this same phone so many times for no reason. There wasn’t any virus or hack or whatever. Something really small happened like I set it up to fast and I’ll factory reset it again and do it again. It’s hard to explain. I also have social anxiety when I’m in school. I’m constantly on guard in class. And I tremble a lot too. Very stiff. I’m very paranoid like people are watching me or something. But I could just be a pedophile with ocd so I don’t know. I’ve been worrying about this for a while so it doesn’t faze me like it once did. I swear if it turns out I’m not a pedophile my life will be fucking complete. I don’t need anything else in life. As long as I’m not a pedophile I’ll enjoy the rest of my life with everything I have. Being a pedophile will really upset me. I mean I won’t kill myself. I’ll definitely try living but it’s going to suck very very badly. Nobody will be my friend except probably other pedophiles. Okay I’m done writing. Hope I get any response from this post. I don’t need reassurance I’m not a pedophile I get that all the time from people. I just want the damn truth. I know people can’t answer that for me though.

I have 2 indoor cats and they take baths regularly,but most importantly i clan their litterbox everytime there are signs of pee and as soon as they poop so they wont get dirty.I also clean their paws regularly.What i love about them is that theyre very very soft and warm and never smell bad so im fine being around them and cleaning up fur daily(in my mind their fur is ok because its not contaminated),unlike street cats or outdoor cats.But with dogs this doesnt work.

t2_4hgu52ja,"Background: 30/M/UK

Around 10 years ago I had an intrusive thought that persisted and developed into Pure O. It lead to broader OCD and a complete breakdown that changed the course of my life.

Today I can say I rarely if ever have any intrusive or obsessive thoughts. Hopefully my story can help others with a faster recovery.


It began with a single thought that spiralled out of control. I was a very normal happy guy, above average in looks, personality, kind and thoughtful, very modest too :) 

I won't dwell on the intrusive thoughts, it was the usual... violent, sexual in nature, very disturbing things which were beyond comprehension. I felt horrible, insecure, and drained all the time. i.e. peodophilia, relative being mutilated, questioning my identity, my mind had unravelled there were no limits.
I couldn't leave the house without repuslive random intrusions.

A severe intrusion would last about a week in my mind, along with endless rumination to try to make sense and put things right.

I developed a sort of ritual OCD alongside to try and cope with the thoughts, i.e. repeating certain names, counting numbers, rethinking the opposite. At my peak, I shut myself off from the world and fell into the abyss, I had lost control of my mind, life was not worth living anymore.

I reneged restless day and nights, ruminating on thoughts, dissecting, analysing every moment.

I started to self medicate with 5htp and supplements but nothing helped. I later on sought help from various psychologist, CBT and ultimately a psychiatrist. 


What helped me get through this?

Not avoiding life and carrying on as normal as possible, it's fine to not feel great but don't deprive yourself of moments and experiences you'd enjoy.

You are the same person, you are just reacting to unpleasant thoughts.
 
Simply expose yourself to situations as normal which cause the anxiety, try not to react to them. I know how hard this was for me, but I promise you do not give these intrusive thoughts the time of you day.
If needed reduce any rituals or rumination by 5 mins each day, set a time slot and move on once you are done.

You must ACCEPT feeling anxious, just take a breath there's nothing you can do: ""I have a thought and feel axiety, yep so what?"" Take a moment to accept your state of mind and how you feel.

Most people have distressful thoughts but do not react to them, subconsciously their identity is intact. You are your own person, not a fictious thought or someone else's crime. No need to analyse or doubt yourself, it is a waste of time. Everyone is capable of doing bad things, but you are not one of them, acting on a thought is completely different, 20 years prior to OCD should indicate this so just relax.

I never once acted on any pure O thoughts.  People who are at a disposition of enacting disturbing thoughts would likely not worry about it at all, so it's good sign that you have them but totally unnecessary to keep going over them as we already established who you are as a person - pure O will not change this! 


Take steps to alleviate the anxiety, perhaps remove toxic people from your life, or triggers which may exacerbate, do something you might enjoy like a trip.

As mentioned previously reduce any rituals or rumination by 5 mins each day, set a time slot and move on. Take it easy, be kind to yourself and take a moment to rest if needed but don't deprive yourself from things you would enjoy. Try to remain social, even if you don't feel great. Don't worry about it this will pass just like a bad trip on LSD. 

They say time is the best healer. Some recover quicker than others. But there's plenty of time trust me so live in the present.

If you are in the the midst of your OCD let me tell you it gets better, your mind will eventually adjust to this bullshit and not care anymore, the intrusions will stop.

If you are having severe episodes regularly go to your GP, get a prescription of Paroxetine or Effexor to assist with your recovery. These were the most effective for me and I tried the whole counter. Almost half the population in America are on prescription. Have some CBT sessions to get a helpful outside perspective.


Scars do remain but the torment has parted, with just ocasional reminders of what it use to be like and how far I am from back then.

Feel free to ask any questions, I would be glad to help or provide advice. If there's a particular issue your struggling with, perhaps I can share a similar anecdote.

I've tried searching online and I guess I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience to me or if this is related to OCD. I'm honestly kind of embarrassed so I haven't talked to my doctor about it but I feel like it's interfering a bit with my professional life, as crazy as that  sounds. 

Basically, ever since I was a kid I've been obsessed with scotch tape. I'll just play with it and put it between my fingers, and then throw it away once it loses its stick. We can't keep it in the house, so my boyfriend knows. At work, I can't keep tape on my desk but they have some in the meeting rooms so I'll go in there just to get a piece of tape. Like I said, this has been since I was a kid as long as I can remember. I've been diagnosed with OCD and anxiety for unrelated issues and i'm on 40mg of Prozac now but this obsession is still there. Is this related to OCD or something else? Has anyone had a similar experience?

t2_3p5b38db,"Hi all. Been a reader of this subreddit for a while but never posted until now. 

Ever since I can remember, I’ve combed through every interaction I have with someone and find ways I could have offended someone. Therapists did not seem to understand the level to which I do this and have just said I have anxiety, which I could never relate to (I mean, I could on some levels, but not with my obsessions about offending people—anxiety didn’t seem to scrape the surface). It’s only relatively recently (in the last two years) that I’ve come to realize that I think it’s OCD, but all examples I can find of this moral component online have to do with religion, and mine doesn’t have to do with religion at all—it’s more that I’ve deeply harmed someone’s life through insulting them by something I’ve said, and that I’m a bad person because of it.

For example, last night I was hanging out with my friend, who is polyamorous. I got a little drunk and asked them about what it’s like to be polyamorous. From an objective standpoint, they (they’re nonbinary) didn’t seem to be offended and shared with me openly, but I keep thinking they’re secretly angry and think I’ve oppressed them. 

This is just one example, but I collect these instances and replay them over and over, and I can’t seem to let them go, and they all pile up as evidence that I’m wreaking havoc everywhere I go, and I get the unbelievably strong urge to apologize or ask if I’ve offended them, even if the occurrence was years ago. I’m usually able to stop myself from acting in these compulsions, because I’ve found that it alienates people and also that it doesn’t get rid of my thoughts.

I can’t keep doing this. All examples I find online don’t apply to me and it’s all just so lonely (and I don’t have insurance and live in a very rural area so therapy is a bit out of the question).

t2_1on2t8jv,"Hi. I'm in psychoteraphy and we have started doing ERP. To this point it has been mostly just picturing the things I fear in my head and accepting the possibility that they could be/become real. This is exhausting and feels awful, but I'm not going to give up. I have so many different fears it's really frustrating (intrusive thoughts about harming, cheating, existential, doing something inappropriate suddenly, am I a bad person, and the list goes on...).

I've read about erp with pure o, especially with harm OCD. There are a lot of ERP exercises that involve a patient being in the situations they fear and kind of doing the things they fear. For example, if someone fears they might hurt someone or themselves, there is an exercise where they hold a knife on someone's or themselves throat. Or they fear they might touch someone in an inappropriate way, so the exercise is to hug a lot. These kind of exercises don't sound good to me at all. Not just because of the anxiety, but they just (for me) feel like things I don't want to physically do, if they are things I _normally_ wouldn't do. I don't want to physically create scenarios in order to do ERP. It just does not feel like a good option to me on any level. 

My question is: can I do ERP without physically getting involved with my fears? Can I do ERP mentally, imagining situations? I'm also willing to read, to record myself saying my fears out loud, writing them, watchig triggering movies, and stuff like that. Can I make it work like that?

Wouldn't want to disappoint my therapist by telling them I don't want to do specific type of exercises, but that's just how I truly feel.

t2_44x3ti8l,"I'm a 29 year old male with a really nasty history with porn/ sex addiction. After many failed attempts to better myself, and after a severe suicidal ideation I had yesterday, I've decided I have to take in my dedication to really get over this.

TRIGGER WARNING: This includes some graphic/ extreme kinks. Please proceed with caution.

I suffer from severe OCD. I go through phases when it barely affects my life and phases where it completely takes over and everywhere in between. I'm gonna try to keep this all as short as possible, but knowing me, I'm gonna fail at that.

I started my porn viewing when I was 13. I would sneak it on my dad's computer and computers at the local youth center. I also started cybering around the age of 15, and it's been the cybersex that has been my biggest addiction. Ever since then, I've always been obsessed with using fantasies and scenarios to get women to cum. 

I started using r/gonewild and other subreddits to find willing participants to talk dirty to. I started noticing my kinks getting more extreme. I've been told that this desensitization is like building of tolerance to a drug. I found myself desensitized to urine play and even scat. It was always about knowing that I could use these kinks to get women to cum that really excited me. I guess it made me feel ""special"" or ""wanted"".

Eventually I got into CNC (consensual non-consent, meaning that the a submissive gives consent to a Dom to enact a rape). Now I'm about to use a bunch of ""he"" pronouns for someone who at the time identified as female and later came out as trans. I met this guy on reddit on one of the CNC subs. He actually lived in the same state as me. So we met up and formed a relationship. We're no longer a couple. Once he came out as trans, I tried for 2 months to get it to work, but I couldn't do it. I'm just not attracted to men. We still live together and are working towards transitioning to a close friendship.

Me and this guy would get involved in some extreme play, even some CNC. He gave me permission to ""use"" him however I felt. We had a communicated safeword and everything. He told me he wanted me to use him no even if he wasn't ""in the mood"", which lead to a lot of forced anal penetration, which he had told me on quite a few occasions that he liked. He also hated my cybering and porn viewing habits. With the exception of a couple of slip ups, I gave up cybering but kept viewing porn behind his back.

Then one morning after one of these sessions, he stormed out of the room. He had a panic attack and told me that there were several times during our sessions that he wanted to use his safeword but couldn't. Not because I would cover his mouth or force his face into a pillow, but because he's an abuse victim. His dad was a narcissistic asshole that made him afraid of confrontation and his brother sexually assaulted him when he was 7. 

Knowing all of this made me sick to my stomach. To any of you reading this that don't already know, if your partner is an abuse victim, you have to be extremely sensitive to any non-verbal queues, even if the play in question involves your partner pretending to not want it. Break character, ruin the mood slightly. I don't care. Don't make the mistakes I did! This made me feel sick and like I was no better than an intentional rapist. It made me realize that my extreme kinks were unhealthy and that they came from desensitization from porn. I made a stab at making a recovery, to get myself away from these kinks and back to a normal sex life. If I really have any of these kinks, they'll stick, but they'll be explored in healthier environments and settings. 

I installed Forever Accountable (highly recommended, btw). I curbed my porn addiction slightly. My viewing habits went down dramatically. I made my ex my accountability partner. But I'd always search for ways around it. Joining vaguely sexual Facebook groups, looking at memes, music videos, etc. I started seeing a therapist, Mark. He proved to be amazingly helpful. But then my awesome insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield) decided not to pay him, so he cut me off after about 6 sessions. This left me devastated.

Eventually I ended up breaking up with my ex not just because I'm not attracted to men... But because I wanted to get back into cybering. And I did exactly that. I guess mentally I figured ""fuck it, nothing's going right anyways."" I removed my ex as an accountability partner and instead had a close friend of mine do it. And he was WAY more lenient. 

Over the next month I used reddit to once again seek out women to talk dirty to. I kept promising myself I'd stop once I got bored with it, but that never happened.

Now... What I'm about to say is incredibly controversial and troubling. I feel so fucked up typing this, but it's the biggest motivation I now have to get myself over this. I have a project I'm working on for my YouTube channel where I am going to cover American popular music history. I was reading this book on New Wave and one of the bands they covered was Bow Wow Wow. On their introductory page was photo of a naked girl, shot from the back, not private bits showing. Well, turns out as I read on I discover that the girl is the lead singer and she was 14 at the time the photo was taken. This was a week ago that I saw this.

My brain would not stop obsessing about underage girls. I want to make this clear, I HAVE NOT ACTED OUT ON THESE OBSESSIONS! But I'm absolutely terrified that I'm going to. Yesterday, my brain kept saying ""you should go on a site where you can pursue these girls"" and I kept screaming internally at myself. Then finally, I got extremely close to doing it, stopped, and had a mental breakdown. For the first time in my life, I self harmed and contemplated suicide. Then, in this horrible, anxious, shitty mood, I had to go to work. And during my breaks I kept looking up how to deal with these uncomfortable thoughts.

What I found is that pedophillic thoughts can come from our good old friend desensitization. I'm not okay exploring this and its fucking time I took this problem 1,000% seriously. I'm hoping I'm not a legit pedophile. I know there's pedophiles that don't act on their urges. I also know that it could also be my OCD doing this to me, but Shaq don't play that game. I'm not taking the risk of this NOT being my OCD. And it honestly terrifies me to death.

There's my story and its not even everything. I'm shaking at some of the reactions I'm going to get. I'm scared I'm going to get ridiculed for what I've done, especially that last part. But I'm reaching out. I can't do this alone. I've started looking for a new therapist and I'm legit done with this shit.",How could my OCD be contributing to my sex/ porn addiction?,OCD,9,cyftke,False
t2_7w01bf3,"This is Google's description:

OCD often centers on themes such as a fear of germs or the need to arrange objects in a specific manner. Symptoms usually begin gradually and vary throughout life.

People may experience:

Behavioral: agitation, compulsive behavior, compulsive hoarding, hypervigilance, impulsivity, meaningless repetition of own words, persistent repetition of words or actions, repetitive movements, ritualistic behavior, or social isolation

Mood: anxiety, apprehension, guilt, or panic attack

Psychological: depression or fear

Also common: food aversion, nightmares, or repeatedly going over thoughts



I have had pretty much every one of those symptoms except nightmares and fear of germs, but they are not necessarily consistently happening all the time. Some symptoms are very frequent others not so much, but I've experienced all of them in one capacity or another; I am probably experiencing these symptoms more mildly than others may have I'm not sure. The symptoms are so far only minimally interfering with my quality of life.

I have this really weird thing with the door. One single time I shut the side door of our house on the way out and it didn't shut right. I immediately saw it didn't shut right and closed it right. Our 3 huge dogs didn't escape, nothing happened. Since then (~2years ago), I cannot leave the house without checking the door anywhere from 2-10 times. Some times (rarely) I have even closed the door, checked it again, got in the car, got out of the car, checked it again, got back into the car and pulled down the driveway and down the street,  turned around and went back to check it again, each time it it's totally soundly locked and not accidentally open. This behavior feels very much out of my control; sometimes it's worse than others, but I always check it at least 2 or 3 times no matter what. It drives my wife nuts....

One more relevant detail. I was in a bad car accident 6 years ago and broke my femur. The 1/2lb metal rod they used to fix my leg was defective or something and caused me intense, horrific pain for several years. I finally convinced the surgeons it was causing me problems and they begrudgingly took it out. That was about 2 years ago. I still had pain after that, but it was less. I downgraded from prescription pain pills, to mostly kratom (with occasional hydrocodone) . After a while I noticed I was kind of accidentally addicted to opioids and it was probably causing some of my pain (see: opioid induced hyperalgesia), so I started buprenorphine.  I feel a lot better and more stable and have minimal pain now, but I still have the psychological baggage of my 6 year traumatic experience with the wreck, the rod, and the ""medicine"". First my mental illness was anxiety, then depression added on after a while, now I'm worried its progressed to OCD. I think it's all because of the the trauma; it's been hard on both me and my wife living like this for so long.


-Will it get worse from here? Is Schizophrenia next!?
-Can I reverse it or employ some preemptive behavior modification that will slow the progression of the disease? 
-Do I even sound like I have actual OCD or is it possible just a side affect of the traumatic experience?

 It's really starting to concern me and I'm hoping someone can share their experience of recognizing they had this mental illness and how they went about overcoming it. I'm so scared.

t2_290iid1t,"Hi, my name is Denis and I‘m from Switzerland. I‘m writing some rap texts as a hobby (for myself and very close friends). I tend to get really creative and experimental. So my new project is sort of a theme album about mental health.
I‘ll try to cover several mental disorders and neurological conditions. To start with, I chose ADD (technical, ADHD subtype ADHD-I or -PI), Depression, OCD, Insomnia and ASD.

I myself got ADD and an ASD. I went through depression as a child and teenager. So these texts where easy to write. But I believe that the intensive personal feeling of a track stands and falls with the description of personal views. I want the tracks to be an insight as close to reality as it can be.

In order to achieve this, I need the personal view of actually affected people. It would be great if you could just write down, what you‘d like other people to know. This could be: daily struggles, misunderstanding in public, feelings, vent/rant, etc. 
If you can think of another disorder/condition, that can deliver enough information for a whole track, it would be great if you could recommend it to me.
If not, absolutely no problem. Thanks for reading ;)

None of these tracks will ever reach the internet, I guess. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.",Personal insights of living with OCD,OCD,1,cygj89,False

t2_c8wnfz7,"Well for years I thought all the weird ticks and rituals I did are normal. They started when I was about 5 years old I had to do everything a certain way. Years went on and I was diagnosed with a slew of problems including Anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and Depression. I have always been able to hide them in my relationships and most of them did not last long enough to let anyone in. I have been in my current relationship for 5 years and are getting married this year. Well, two and half years into my relationship my fiance tells me that she can't deal with the OCD that is always accompanied by intrusive thoughts. This was during my first semester at a new school that was much larger than the previous one. I loved her so I did what I thought was best and took all of my OCD related things and buried them deep down in an attempt to smother them. Well, they have come back and they are worse than before... I am my worst enemy and know all my insecurities... I don't think I am intelligent enough to be in the program I am in and constantly battle these voices during school. I will say things like ""You are too stupid to be here"" , ""You are f\*\*\*king loser and worthless"" , and other self-destructive things like that. I have tried in the past to end my life and now the thoughts I have every day are getting worse... I am having intrusive thoughts that are egging me on to kill myself. I come from a place that mental health is a taboo and even though I am in the United States my family still think its a cowards thing to do. I have always had to be the strong one for my family but I just am tired of existing and its starting to become harder to live. I have tried everything at this point the compulsions are just becoming unbearable it's like they have adapted and come back ten times stronger.

t2_4hqqxxne,"I’m a fourteen year old male. Now I already posted a couple posts about this same topic on this account. I have posted way more about this and my other obsessions on tons and tons of my previous accounts but I deactivated them and got rid of them because I think I have like electronic ocd. Like I guess it has to be perfect. If something really small goes wrong than itll bother me so much we’re I’ll delete the account and make a new one. And the cycle repeats itself over and over. So I’m going to delete this account eventually too, because well... I think I may have ocd. I have other obsessions like fear that I am bisexual and a fear that I’m transgender. The fear isn’t actually gay, because I know I’m not gay deep down because I love woman and I’ve had crushes on woman. But I do worry about being bisexual. And I worry about being transgender. But it’s not like I showed any signs of being transgender when I was a lot younger. There where no signs as far as I’m concerned. And I know deep down I’m not transgender too. But I still worry about it regardless because I don’t know. It’s a fear I guess. I’m happy as a male and don’t think I want to switch to boobies or a va-J-J anytime soon. I like having a tube coming out my body and shit. I did experience something like gender dysphoria, but I don’t think it was gender dysphoria looking back at it now. It was probably just me being extremely uncomfortable. Basically what I think happened was, I was fearing being transgender so I went into the bathroom looked in the mirror and straight up gropped my man boobies and I was being really rough with myself. I did it to kind of test if I’d be happier with boobs, so I tried pretending I had boobs and gropped myself. I even like grabbed my ass and shook it as hard as I possibly could. When I came out the bathroom that’s when I experienced the discomfort that I really thought at the time was gender dysphoria. But now that I look back it probably wasn’t. It was probably just real discomfort over what I fucking did to myself. Like I was lying down after and felt uncomfortable and just, weird I guess. I was really rough so maybe I was alittle shocked or something I don’t know. This is about POCD though. Right now, I don’t really feel like I’m a pedophile. I mean I do a little bit because I guess that’s what POCD does. It makes you feel like a pedo. But after a lot of thinking about all of this, I guess that’s ruminating, right? I am just choosing to not worry about it. It’s really hard not to worry because I do feel like a pedophile and I want answers to whatever this is. I’ve been on this reddit thing a lot today thinking about pedophilia. I’ve never worried about being a pedophile before. And I know I can’t just magically be a pedophile. It’s something that your born with. But despite knowing that. I can’t help but still worry. The reason why I’m posting again is because I’ve noticed that even when I’m not worrying about being a pedophile I still can’t help but think about the kids outside playing. I might just be sub subconsciously thinking about it or it’s in the back of my mind at all times or something. Like I was in the kitchen eating some junk food and there’s kids screaming a lot outside just being kids. And even though at the time I wasn’t necessarily worrying about being a pedo because I’m choosing not to, I couldn’t help but just pay attention to the kids screaming outside my house. I wasn’t fantasizing about them sexually and I don’t want to anyway. I wasn’t thinking about them romantically also. It was just, whenever they were screaming my focus went to their screams. Sometimes I even waited for them to scream. I don’t get why. Like it was hard doing what I was doing because my attention shifted to the children screaming. Now I know it doesn’t make me a pedophile but still. I get urges sometimes to. I don’t get urges to do anything to children or to touch them or whatever. Like I don’t want to molest them or anything. I don’t want to do that to them. It’s just whenever I’m in the kitchen looking for food in my fridge and there’s children outside playing I get an urge. I don’t know what the urge is actually. Like I don’t know what kind of urge it is. It’s just an urge, it’s weird. I have a window in my kitchen so it could be an urge to go by the window or something. I’m not sure if it’s an urge to look at the children outside or what. Whenever I get the urge I kind of fight it and sometimes I just leave the kitchen because I hate how it makes me feel like it’s a pedophile urge. I never worried about being a pedophile before, but than again pedophilia develops around this age I think. Or is it something people are born with? I don’t know. Are these Ocd kind of urges or pedophile urges. I obviously don’t want to be a pedophile. Nobody does. It’s horrible. I don’t want to have an abnormal attraction to kids. But why do I get urges. I don’t get an urge to open my door walk outside and molest a child, he’ll no. I can’t describe it really. It’s hard. It might just be an urge to look out the window or something. Sometimes I think I get an urge to be silent and and listen outside. I’m not sure if I’ve gotten urge like that actually. I think I had one like that once. I just feel like a pedophile and I don’t like. I won’t act on it or anything and I don’t think I even want to either. If I am a pedophile I’ll 100% get help from someone and find better attractions or whatever. It’s just the urges I get. Is that ocd or what? And like I said, there’s children outside playing a lot. And one of the children has fucking Tourette’s and can’t shut the actual fuck up, seriously. I don’t mean to be rude or anything. I really shouldn’t because I got mental issues myself. I just wish they could put something tight over his mouth so he can be quiet. It’s just whenever those children scream especially the girls I can’t help but just focus on their screaming. Maybe I’m paranoid or something. Maybe I’m thinking about it in the back of my mind. I’m pretty sure it’s always in the back of my mind. Maybe their screams are bothering me.

t2_15uw17,"I made a post a few days ago about how I was struggling with wanting to go back to a specific location and touch something I hadn't touched. The feelings were so intense, until last night they suddenly subsided and I woke up this morning feeling amazing.

It was my first time really trying ERP-style treatment, and I felt like after a really hard fight I had come out a winner. I felt on top of the world. I felt cured.

Then, I had a new compulsion related to my original one. I thought, hey, this feels bad but I just beat the big one so time will pass and I'll beat this one too. However a few hours later, before I could even register what I was doing, I gave in to the new compulsion.

Now I feel terrible. I feel like I am no longer fighting anything. I feel empty. Since this one was related to the original compulsion, I feel like I should have just done the original one too. Or that the ERP fight wasn't even worth it, like I just wasted a week of my life. Or that I should still go do the original one and just start over from square one, because unless I do it perfectly I feel like I have no fight in me. I know rationally it's almost like alcoholism - you wouldn't tell an alcoholic that because they had one sip of beer they should then drink the whole bar. But that's how it feels.

Does anyone else struggle with times of highs followed by setbacks and then struggle with feeling like you need to do it all perfectly or start with a clean slate? Is ANY resistance to a compulsion worth it, even if you didn't do it perfectly? I feel like ERP is all-or-nothing, and I only tried it once and feel like I failed.

t2_4e9h2qi1,"This post isn't purely about OCD but I'll start there.

I think I have contamination OCD. If something is ""dirty"" I can't/won't touch it. If I do I will keep from touching anything else until I wash my hands. I also try to make sure it doesn't touch anything else to keep it from ""spreading"".

I can remember having these thoughts back when I was maybe 5-8 years old. I'm not 100% sure how it started in my case but I have a theory. I think it started off with something rational that just got way out of hand. Here's an analogy. Maybe when I was younger I got some crap on a toy. So it was obviously dirty so I cleaned it and threw it in the box with the rest. Then the thought surfaced that maybe I didnt clean it well. Now they could all be dirty. I wasn't just gonna throw them away so I kept them but the problem is the thoughts stayed and over time the ""contamination"" spread.

It got to the point that I stopped asking for gifts for christmas, birthdays, etc and buying things because they would just get contaminated and I wouldn't want them anymore. This in itself was very bad for me psychologically. I couldn't do much of anything and even my clothes always felt contaminated so I took that ""feeling"" everywhere I went.

Eventually i got so angry and frustrated that I blew up at home as I basically had no life. I was admitted to a mental hospital and treated for psychosis. I told the doctor I thought I had OCD and that's the reason I blew up. I was embarassed so I didnt share the details so I understand why he couldn't diagnose me with OCD but come on psychosis? Even if he doesn't know about my OCD, if I tell him there's a legitimate reason for my outburst he can't say I'm psychotic can he?

Anyway after a month they let me go. I stopped the meds and a while later I blew up again as I still had the same problem. Back into hospital for 7 months. When I came out of hospital this time, I convinced my parents to redo my room: new furniture, new clothes, everything. My idea was that as long as I had my safe space for me and my things I could deal with contamination outside as long as was careful not to contaminate my stuff again. IT WORKED. BETTER THAN EXPECTED. I started working again, buying stuff, enjoying myself. Over time I think it worked like some kind of ERP where little things bugged me but then I got over it until the thoughts pretty much went away and now I'd say I'm managing amazingly well with that.

My hospital admissions are my new problem however. I was really angry at the time as I felt I was being mistreated. And I still get angry. I've had two more outbursts and both times landed me in hospital. The first of these, after 2 weeks they decided I was just angry about my admission and let me go. I went home and I think I became depressed due to what they did and a week later was my last outburst. Another 5 months in hospital.

I'm gonna leave it there as there isn't much more to say anyway. I just have a few questions. Based on what I've said (and I know I could be biased):

Do you think I have/had OCD?

Can an anger outburst really be psychosis if it was for a legitimate reason? I'm not excusing my behaviour but I don't think I was psychotic.

Finally, I feel like I've now fallen into a trap. A cycle where I get angry about the past which gets me admitted and ""treated"". I really would like to sue the hospital as I think that could get me the closure I need. WHat are my chances of winning?",Contamination OCD?,OCD,2,cyibkj,False

t2_437k6ddm,Hi guys I just recently joined this sub as I suspect I have ocd or at least some traits of it . Lately a big fear of mine that I can’t stop thinking about is the fact that I could have high functioning autism/ nvld. Im in college right now and have not really had any friends or gone to many parties since high school started. I have  really bad social anxiety and BPD so that probably explains most of it . But my mind keeps telling me that I have a disorder which can cause social dysfunction. For the beginning of this year I started thinking I probably have aspergers/ high functioning autism cause the doctor said I could have after meeting me once cause he said I have a flat affect lol. I started getting super anxious and worried about the possibility of having it. I researched the hell out of the topic and I didn’t arrive at the conclusion of having it or not. My anxiety and fear just got more and more worse. Then I started seeing a new psychologist for my anger issues and after all the testing she said that I have BPD and generalized anxiety disorder. She then enrolled into the DBT program there so then obsessions decreased and I started putting my focus on some of the more anger and personality issues. But then all of a sudden  when I was hanging out with my cousin he said I am really awkward and made a joke that I have no friends. That sent me into a downward spiral where I started researching everything I could to explain my situation and looked through my past psych reports . One of the reports I found said that because of the difference of my performance and verbal IQ that my cognitive profile aligns with that of non verbal learning disability. it mentioned that they’re not sure but it could explain my introversion.  Then I researched non verbal learning disability and found that it can cause social issues very similar to autism such as not being able to read facial expressions. I started getting super scared and thought I won’t amount to anything in life. This is basically still going on and after confirming with three psychologists that they don’t see that I have this issue I still ruminate about it almost every day.

t2_5hmry,"Hi there. In the past couple of weeks, I had a bit of an incident that has irreparably damaged a friendship brought on by my unstable mental state, which in turn seemed to be brought on or at least enhanced because I stupidly got careless with taking antidepressant medication. Naturally, I eventually was cognizant enough to realize ""oh shit, this is very much not the way i normally am"" and started taking steps to course correct and prevent this from happening again. part of it, suggested by my therapist, was seeing my psychiatrist again who i hadn't seen in a few years (I being prescribed the medicine through my physician). we had a long talk, and after i explained the whole record of events that happened the past few weeks, she told me two things: first, the fact that i stopped taking the medication wasn't the issue, it was that I started back up. Sometimes this medicine has an side effect of greatly increasing anxiety, which caught me off guard since when I initially started taking it I felt no side effects. and second was that i most likely have OCD. Particularly relationship OCD which I didn't even know was a thing. I never really even considered this a possibility because I don't have any noticeable compulsions, like excessive hand washing or something to choose a classic example. She said that's because my compulsions are pretty much all mental, based on what I described to her. Which... made sense, when she laid it out like that.

I'm not really sure why I'm making this post, honestly. Maybe a desire for solidarity? Reassurance it'll get better? This is the second friendship I've tanked in this type of way, along with in retrospect dozens of other ones that i've probably ruined because of this before they had a chance to fully grow, and now I'm doing a classic ultra pessimist outlook of assuming any serious relationship I have will ultimately end up exactly like this again, unless I somehow get a handle on this side of me. I'm just... I don't know. Scared, I suppose.

t2_4i2b63qs,"I have been seeing someone for about 2-3 months and tonight a kind of bell went off that the person I am seeing may have some COCD issues.  Some things that have occurred this far that I am now seeing a bit of a pattern in:
* heavy use of insect repellent
* many complaints of bug bites
* desire to sleep in insect tent indoors
* constant vacuuming of carpet
* applications of baking soda to carpet
* steaming of carpet
* multiple daily spraying of furniture and carpet with rubbing alcohol to kill bugs

So about a month ago the partner mentioned they thought they had bed bugs on bed mattress they had gotten used and they had been waking up feeling bites and thought it was mosquito, but now think it was bed bugs.  This led to getting rid of that furnace and all the things I mentioned above plus near constant laundering of all clothing and high heat drying.  This would seem like a normal approach to cure the problem, but I never got bit and I had laid on the bed some and I never got to see one of the bugs.  Of course I panicked a bit myself when I heard the news out of fear they would have made it to my house, but I never got bit or found any evidence.

Anyway tonight the partner told me they have a nagging fear that they need to cut open the chair and couch cushions to make sure the bugs are not hiding inside.  That is when it all kind of clicked that there must be something more going on.  Any of of the things taken apart seems normal, but all of it together has me wondering.

t2_smsr469,"I’m sorry, I know there are a lot of posts like this... I’m having a really bad night.

I’m 23 and have been with a man a little older than me for over five years. My whole life I have been attracted to older men and women but lately I’ve been struggling with what I think and hope is POCD and it’s miserable. 

I’ve had OCD ever since I can remember, with the worst one being harm OCD. It was so bad that I literally just slept all day and didn’t eat hardly anything for a few months because I was so depressed. I never had issues with POCD thoughts until recently when we’ve been around kids a lot more. We spent 4 years in another country and I never had thoughts until now we live with his family and are around like 10 kids every weekend and every time it’s miserable for me. I get such bad anxiety over it to where I’ve literally thought about killing myself but even that doesn’t make me feel better because the idea that I could even be this monster is irredeemable. I perform these compulsions like “look at this wall for 20 seconds and if I do that then I’m not a pedofile” or like “blink 10 times in a row otherwise I’ll end up doing something bad” but sometimes these thoughts feel so real. Every time I freak out I have a past memory that just enforces it.

Like sometimes I’ve seen younger preteens and have thought like “they’re going to be so handsome when they get older” etc and it’s never anything weird or sexual but it scares me. I’ve never even thought about anything like that sexually, in fact I hardly have a libido because everytime I get intimate with my husband I get these intrusive thoughts and it scares me so bad that I can’t enjoy it, so I don’t even want to do it. All my life I’ve had crushes on older men or men my age and that’s the only thing comforting me. I’m scared to tell anyone cuz like?? That’s just going to make me sound like a monster. I’ve gone to therapy before and it helped with my harm OCD but now this POCD is spiking up since I’m around children all the time. 

It sucks because I used to love being around kids and playing games with them and whatnot, I always wanted kids for the longest time but now I don’t even want to be around them because I’m so scared. I kept thinking about how one of my nephews is cute and he’s going to grow up and be handsome and I feel like a disgusting monster. Right after I got this nasty intrusive thought and I didn’t even feel excitement or anything I was just like ew wtf? And now I’m spiraling. I love kids but they annoy me with how immature they can be so the fact that I’m even worrying about this is dumb but it feels so real. 

I feel like I can’t be around my family anymore because I feel sick. I finally told me husband about it and he reassured me that I’m not and that we all have bad thoughts sometimes, these things are normal. It’s just scary. I never even want to be around kids because of this. I can’t drink either because after I do I get terrified that I must’ve gotten drunk and did something awful but I just don’t remember it. I feel disgusted with myself and it makes me want to die. But what if I’m just in denial? Ugh it scares me. I’d rather die than be some sicko that would hurt anyone.

\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*

so since i was really, really young i had this weird fetish for people fainting n shit and it scared me and i dont really know if i still have it.

and when i started masturbating (at like, 14 i think? i can't really remember, i think i started doing it later than my friends) i would only do it to things pertaining to this

the problem is i definitely did to like, people younger than me faking it. like too much younger than me. the weird thing is there was never *really* a sexual connotation to it

but i did it to people younger than me until at the very least 16, maybe 17.

JUST TO BE CLEAR i have never had a sexual desire for children, literally ever, but when i was younger if someone was younger than me but participating in said fetish i would be able to be aroused by it. or maybe i wasn't but the thought of someone older participating in it actually were the thoughts going through my brain? who fucking knows

i am legitimately horrified. like the thoughts of that now disgust me (aged 19 at time of writing) and the fact that anything happened to my body because of those images disturbs me to the very core. i am convinced that this means i am a pedophile despite no sexual desire for children

i sorta stopped watching shit with people younger than me in it unless it was appropriate to be attracted to them. like, clearly it just gives me anxiety and OCD now, but because of my past actions i feel as though i've done this to myself and am simply denying my true nature as a weird sex pervert

but i don't believe im a pedophile. i have been attracted to people like, my age and one year younger for most if not my whole life. but because of the fetish stuff i would watch, and if im being honest the people were too young (like 4 years younger than i in some cases when i was 16 or 17). i just want to throw up and fucking die

okay maybe i dont want to *actually* die but this makes me feel like a monster. i dont want to have relations with children and not becasue it's morally wrong but because it truly frightens and disgusts me.

t2_446p86cj,"I gave into my obsessions this weekend. The thoughts of death from all sorts of exotic causes haunted me more strongly than usual for the past couple weeks, with no simple explanation. And so instead of going out and being a normal human being, I huddled next to my video games, fighting off intrusive thoughts with the occasional loud, grunting noise or specific method of coughing.

Sometimes it actually does work. Giving yourself time away from the intrusive thoughts kind of hits the reset button, and gives you that brief clarity of mind needed to achieve mindfulness. But you have to be super involved with whatever it is that you're doing. Sometimes the thoughts just plain win, and if they're particularly mean, you strap yourself in for a panic attack.

I'm not sure why but I decided to poke the OCD bear on Friday evening. I think I was just so fed up of my current obsession that I needed another one to replace it. So ignoring my better judgement I walked onto the psychological minefield of crowdsourced horror stories. And I listened to one after another. I maintained a detached fascination until I ran into one that triggered a chain of existential dread. What a surprise, right?

Trigger warning level 1.

It's been a while since I experienced existential OCD. It was more of a feature of my teen years when I was an obsessive Christian of some sort. Thoughts of the afterlife haunted me, tortured me. A friend of mine at the time told me he was ""scared of Heaven"". It got me to thinking... is there an afterlife that isn't existentially horrifying? Eternal anything is a scary thought. I was distracted by my thoughts the entire day after he said that.

Trigger warning level 2.

Fast forward roughly ten years, for some reason I can't recall, I got caught up in the idea of free will, specifically the philosophical case that free will cannot exist. I actually grappled with that one for over a week. Eventually I became at peace with the notion. It was just a philosophical abstraction that I was obsessing over.

Trigger warning level 3.

Which brings me to present day. These stories had me thinking about the afterlife again, and against my better judgement I went online to see what people thought. That's when I ran into yet another idea that inspires existential angst, but this time it's not rooted in rational philosophy. They said the afterlife is what you believe it to be. Basically, and I'm trying to beat around the bush just writing it, the idea was that your belief somehow determines your fate. 

I had remembered thinking about the worst possible afterlife scenarios, a few years back. Basically the idea that you're stuck with the anxiety and the fear that you have on Earth while you're alive, except it's permanent. Like not even death is an escape from the fear.

Put two and two together, and you get the cognito hazard in question. I won't connect the dots explicitly but you can figure it out.

My first thought was basically, damn I wish I hadn't heard that. Then upon contemplation it occurred to me that that particular trigger wasn't the issue, it was my catastrophic thinking patterns. The trigger could have been anything. For a mind like mine, it was only a matter of time. Hey that kind of rhymes.

The obsession in question has kept me even more glued to the computer screen as attempted avoidance. Neglecting chores and fitness, instead opting to give myself space to negotiate with the thoughts. As you know, engaging with the thoughts is like challenging a pig to wrestle in the mud. Only one party enjoys it, and I guarantee it's not you.

The rationalization process I eventually went through was and still is sound. The brain is the seat of the mind, and we're dealing with here is specifically the notion that the mind can exist without the brain.","Haven't left the place in a couple days, thought I was doing so well.",OCD,1,cylqs7,False

I’ve been really really struggling with OCD intrusive thoughts that came out of nowhere, that focused on everything from my relationship with my boyfriend to my family to What If I’m A Lesbian?! (when I’m really bisexual) to a fear of developing schizophrenia, but this is the one that feels the worst. I was just sitting in the car one day and I had an intrusive thought that said “I am transgender.” and it completely terrified me and now it’s my main intrusive thought. It’s calling my whole existence into question. I have to keep repeating in my head “I am Michelle” and “I love my body” and keep touching my breasts to make sure that I’m not disgusted by them and stare at myself naked in the mirror for fear that I don’t like what I see, which of course makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I had to go to the endocrinologist for my thyroid and I was terrified the whole time because I know people get HRT there and my brain kept telling me I’d be going back there for that. I’ve been waking up with chest pain for a whole month, but my OCD has latched onto it and is trying to convince me that it’s not heartburn or a medical condition but it’s actually chest dysphoria. I’m now hyper aware of my breasts and genitals, always checking, checking, checking to make sure that I like them and identify with them. I have several lovely transgender friends and I love and respect the trans community, but I know that I’m a girl, not a trans man. The intrusive thoughts are so convincing though. I used to love my body and be proud of it, now I’m terrified and confused. I know that if it came true I’d lose my family and my boyfriend and those are my worst fears. I just want to be myself again, but I know I’m stuck with the OCD so I at least want to move onto an obsession that doesn’t involve me losing my family as most of my intrusive thoughts do. My days are filled with frantic Googling and “I am Michelle” and chewing in that syllable pattern and the touching and the checking. I wish it would all go away. The OCD in general is straining my relationships with everyone I know, I’m suffering in school, and I’m severely depressed. All out of nowhere. If you are dealing with this kind of obsessional OCD, how can I keep myself sane until I get ERP? What can I possibly do?

t2_4i4t2yit,"Decided to make an account just for this... First of all, English isn't my native language, but I hope you still understand. Second, I don't know how coherent this is, but hopefully it'll get there in the end.

I've been struggling with milder OCD-symptoms during my whole life, it's kinda always been there. About 4 years ago things got worse though and I had a really bad time with OCD related to checking: long story short, it was pure hell leaving from work or home because I was so afraid that I had left the stove or computers or any electronic devices on and I would cause a fire by that. I went back to check again or asked for reassurance from colleague or friends or family. You know how it works...

Back then I saw a psychologist couple of times and they adviced that I should write list of things I have checked (only once) and then I could check the list if I was uncertain. It kinda made things okay for a while, but didn't actually help. My OCD was always there, but this kind of reassuarance helped me surprisingly much. For a while.

I managed pretty well for couple of years, maybe because I lied to myself about the state I was in. I had obsessions and compulsions which I shrugged off as ""it's reasonable to check the stove when you leave home or it's reasonable to be sure about it by taking a picture"". I justified everything by logical thinking.

Until this summer. I have really gone over the OCD line and very far. It's the checking - it has always been that for me. And if I try to limit my checking, in comes the mental compulsions about thinking how I have most definitely checked for example the oven and all should be fine. Also there is compulsive thinking over propabilities and so on... I know I should stop compulsing like that too, but I don't know how to do it mentally.

Most of my anxieties focus on work related things, the things just change daily to whatever thing is the most catchy for me that day. Today I obsess over whether I could have heated my food on the microwave so that the microwave is left on and I don't somehow notice it - or if there's somehow a setting that could make it start later (automatic timer kind of thing) and that I accidentally used it and now I don't know about it. Just because I was the last one to use the microwave for today. I went back to check it and even opened the door because then I started also obsessing over whether I had mysteriously left some metal cutlery there - and now my obsession is telling me that this is just making *it* more plausible to happen because I checked.

Tomorrow's obsession might be ""what if I left the lights on to the toilet or left the faucet running"". And so on. And I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired of trying everyday. I'm trying so hard to not do these compulsions, and when I some days I give up and do them (like today with the microwave), I feel like I don't even deserve to get better. Everyday I remind myself that I can't be in control of everything and that shit can happen no matter how hard I try. And still I cry two hours secretly at work, because everything is so overwhelming.

I don't even know how to talk to my friends or boyfriend about my OCD, because I feel like usually it just ends up being reassurance for me and that just makes things worse. I feel so alone. I go to theraphy because of my previous depression and other anxiety issues (caused by leaving my childhood religion), but now I also worry that my therapist isn't the right kind for treating OCD (they practice  *Psychodynamic* psychotherapy) and I fear that I will not get any help.

Some background.  I am OCD, which manifests itself with ruminating (my primary, concerning issue) but also causes me to organize and such.  My son is similar, which we thought put him on the spectrum, but with my own OCD diagnosis last year I suspect that's an issue for him, too (of course, after diagnosis I see OCD everywhere!).

He has always dressed in khaki and polo shirts or t-shirts.  Recently, he shared that he has never felt at home with his friends; it is all on the surface.  He's happy, but cut off a bit.  A few years ago he decided he was bisexual, now pansexual, because he could not put his attractions in a single, traditional box.  He has found a group on reddit and is exploring things.

His reason for exploring women's clothing is that he does not feel he fits in the box of masculinity.  At the same time, he says he has no interest in limiting himself in the box of femininity.  In short, he wants to be him and find out what that means.  He knows he's not trans.

I am scared to death for him.  This is on two fronts.  First, it's a hard road.  I don't want him to get the shit kicked out of him or face any of the negative crap society doles out.  As his father, I want to protect him.  Second, I have never been comfortable with trans anything.  I don't like women in make-up or jewelry so anyone making that leap baffles me and I can't get past it.  That's my problem, not my son's.  Except, I want to support him in being happy and finding himself but I am finding it hard to look past the surface.  I think I'm having a harder time with this than he is.

EG for a while I found I really liked wearing nice clothes - then OCD would attach to that making me compulsively obsess were they the correct colour/fit/pattern - you name it! It drove me mad, it was horrible. 

I had to abandon dressing well &amp; instead dress for function. That change was such a massive relief! I don’t care about how I look much at all anymore. 

One thing I really love is exercise and martial arts, just dynamic movement. It makes me completely present, nothing else exists. 

So obsession latches on to that with constant worry I’ll tear a muscle and something I love will be taken away from me. And the worry that will be too emotionally difficult to deal with. 

Like a lot of my OCD, there used to be a logic to this worry - I DO have an old disc injury in my back, and I do have a slightly disabled right leg (from an accident in 2002). 

Both those injuries threw me into 2 years of isolation which was horrible. I associate exercise injuries with nasty depression. 

But that logic is way back in the past, I have great support in my life, no chance of being isolated and alone. So now the worry is ‘plausible but untrue’ and it’s simply OCD. 

I haven’t asked for help with this - not since Pure O has been recognised.

So because of that I looked up why I had an emotionless face and social isolation and it came up with early schizophrenia and after that I have been testing myself with everything I do that’s all I think about. But a couple days ago I went to the doctor but they said it was because of my anxiety and I now have an oppointment with a psychiatrist and after tht I chocked it up to my anxiety and moved on but then I became aware of my breathing at all times now that’s all I think about. I also looked this up and it matched up with sensorimotor ocd linked with pure o and I also learned that could be the reason why I was thinking I had early schizophrenia but then I also seen that ocd is one of the early symptoms of schizophrenia again so now I am back to worrying about that again looking back though before thinking about schizophrenia a had this think with eye contact where I would always think where to look when talking to someone and that became an obsession aswell and thinking back when I was younger I had a weird obsession with my heart and also another one where I always had to know where my sister was because I was worried she would get kidnapped I don’t know if that ties up with any of this but anyway do you guys think that I have early schizophrenia or could it be undiagnosed pure o ocd I am very worried and didn’t know what else to .. also I am 16 years old and none of my family have ocd or schizophrenia.

t2_2qr5m1s5,"Hi everyone. I posted here early this summer because I was worried I was exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behaviour relating to infection and contamination. I hadn't had to deal with anything like OCD before this summer, and it seemed to be ""triggered"" (for lack of a better term) by a very ill-timed virus I got towards the end of my university exam season. Since then, I have been diagnosed with OCD and have been attending therapy sessions and taking SSRIs. 

On balance, I think the treatment has been helping. I recently went on holiday and I made a great deal of progress when I was there, doing things I couldn't have done before I started taking medication/going to therapy. However, since I got back on saturday I've taken a few steps back. I developed cold-like symptoms after the flight home, and since picking up illnesses is the main source of my anxiety, I think I've handled it pretty well. I did, however, resume certain habits I had managed to kick while I was on holiday. 

Then, when my brother got home from work today, he had cold symptoms. It could be the same virus I had but I'm not sure if I even got a fully-blown cold, and even if I did I was extremely careful to wash my hands, not cough into the open air, etc. So, I'm worried he doesn't have the virus I had, but rather picked up something else from work. I basically fled the house and have now been sitting in the cold for an hour because I can't face the prospect of facing yet another illness.

I know it seems silly to worry about little bugs so much, but I cannot stand being out of control, and when I'm ill I have basically zero control over what's going on with my body. It makes me very distressed and I don't think I could cope with another virus after just enduring cold-like symptoms. 

How do I cope with this? Does anyone have any tips on how I can calm myself down enough to go back to the house?

t2_48sko072,"So this is a very strange thing that’s developed. I can touch my tonsils and my uvula and the back of my throat with my tongue. I used to have a tick where I’d mess with the flaps of skin over my wisdom teeth, when they were just breaking through and after they’ve come in, until it would hurt so much. Now it’s turn into me sticking my tongue into the largest hole of my left tonsil, to check for tonsil stones. I don’t always find them of course but I still mess around with it. I do this unconsciously and all the time! Sometimes I do it until they’ll hurt a little but that doesn’t always stop me. I worry Im going to mess them up permanently. And I want to stop but it’s just habitual at this point! I had the thought about removing them but then I’m afraid I’d mess up the healing process with the compulsion! Has anyone heard of anything like this?

Im also afraid Im going to mess them up to the point of them getting infected which is bad because I can’t take antibiotics unless it’s extremely serious because I have had a bad case of C Diff in the pass. I mean, I’m sure it wouldn’t mess my stomach up  as bad as when I actually had c dif but I’m terrified of it relapsing. 



I also have this compulsion to pop acne or pick at the scars. I can get to the point where I catch myself and stop but then I’ll wake up after having thoroughly picking at my face and be annoyed. I never had too bad of acne as a teenager. I started getting cystic acne on my cheeks a few years ago, I think from hormones and stress, and it left scaring that really fucks with me emotionally. I’ve been developing a skin routine to try and fade the scars away naturally (the idea of bleaching them scares me). I’m open to micro needling but it’s just so expensive. Plus this doesn’t get rid of the compulsion to pick! 

Ive only just mentioned  to my dr about the acne scar one. She is switching me off of duloxetine and on to vibryyd. I’m not sure how much it’ll help but she says it’ll stop whatever nervous energy I have to pick. Does that sound right? 

I had been complaining about the terrible side effects to duloxetine for about a year now and I didn’t think it was improving me. She kept changing the dosage but not the meds and now I’m so relieved because she is now having me switch. 

Ugh sorry for the long explanation of all this but I’m not sure who to ask about this and don’t have anything to compare it to.

I have a lot going on right now.  Trying to do a lot around my apartment to get ready to move, basically I had a pot of water on the stove.  It was a large pot, I am also in the living room doing laundry and packing some stuff.

I forgot about the water for a little.  I don't know how long, maybe it was 30 minutes or maybe It was an hour?  I don't know, either way as soon as I remembered I turned it off.  It wasn't boiled away much at all, but I just have really bad obsessive thoughts about my mistakes especially when they waste resources or cost money.  

I have been doing a lot of research about how much it costs to run a gas stove.  I saw one post that this guy was asking how much it cost him when he left on his stove for 12 hours, and an answer was ""maybe 1.21 and thats assuming you have a high running stove"". So did I really only waste a few cents?  I really got distracted because Im getting fucked with by this woman that works in my apartment management and I was dealing with her immaturity and trying to respond to her.  I can't even remember when I put the pot on, maybe it was around 2?  I took it off around 2:30, maybe it was 1:30 or 1:45?  I don't know.  Either way I feel like a horrible person.

t2_3w203u32,"I'm 31 and I've been struggling with OCD and Depression for years. Haven't had great psychs or therapists up to this point.

My OCD has always focused on religious fears (like Hell and similar things). 

I've been taking the generic of Paxil for a few years now. It doesn't really *help* but it kinda keeps me going and I can at least get through the day. Every so often I try a different medication but it doesn't make much of a difference within the 2 month period I give it, so I go back to the Paxil.

Late last year, I noticed I felt like I was having trouble understanding lines in a video game or TV show I was watching. I'd have to go over it again later after I was done, to make sure I understood it. 

As time went on, that would still happen from time to time. Usually it would be because the line of dialogue is actually somewhat confusing, but occasionally that wasn't the case.

In early September, I tried another medication, and after about a week something unexpected happened. My OCD, my regular OCD, spiked worse than I've ever seen. 

The whole nine yards - I'd empty my clothes from the dryer but I would get stuck there because I wasn't totally sure the dryer was empty. I'd send an email to someone but it wouldn't ""click"" in my brain that I'd sent the email. 

And the worst thing has been reading. It's gotten to a point where I will read a certain bit of information and my brain will insist I don't understand it, that I am not processing it at all. If I go ahead and pick it apart later, it turns out I did understand it (nine times out of ten, every so often people just phrase things weirdly). 

But I reached a point where I was honestly scared to do anything. Scared to run into this wall again, regardless of what the activity was. I'd try to put mail into a mailbox but it wouldn't ""click"" in my brain that I successfully put the mail into the slot. I'd drive home worrying that I'd somehow dropped the mail out of the box and that it was lying on the ground.

I decided I wanted to go back on my old medication. My psychiatrist is generally unreachable (I'm in the process of trying to find a new one) so I switched myself back to the Paxil.

It's been a little over a week and I'm still having this trouble. I'm genuinely scared because I feel like I've totally lost it. It shouldn't take this much mental focus and energy to understand things that I read. It never really did before, either.

To anyone who's dealt with this kind of thing, what helps? All I know is to do my best not to feed into the OCD, but it's extremely difficult in that moment that I'm putting the mail in the mailbox. It's insanely hard to continue reading something after reading a section that my brain insists I didn't fully understand.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",I dunno what the hell happened to me,OCD,3,dbzcu7,False
t2_4kn53h9j,"What I am still struggling a lot with is my fear of other peoples' thoughts and judgments towards me. I often seek reassurance by telling myself ""it's okay. people's thoughts are fleeting. if people have negative/critical thoughts towards me, I will never know. It's none of my business. Don't let it get to you!!!""  But this never gives me any kind of lasting comfort.

For years of my life, I hid my body with baggy clothes, no makeup, slouching, etc because I felt very uncomfortable with being ""looked at"" by men. I felt uncomfortable receiving sexual attention. I imagined what thoughts they might be having about me and my body, and I sometimes thought the worst case scenario like ""what if I walk through a crowd and a man checks out my ass and thinks about raping me?""  It made me feel gross. Hiding made me feel safe.  Then I realized that by hiding, I was hiding my light, I was hiding ME. Nowadays, I think it has gotten better. I try to tell myself that most men don't want to harm me and that sexual thoughts towards me would be harmless, natural, and playful. I've tried telling myself to stand up straight because I am safe.  All of that just feels like reassurance though. It doesn't give me any real comfort.My therapist has told me to accept the reality that yes maybe some men out there want to harm me, and yes some men have sexual thoughts-and then I'm supposed to just accept that and go about my life. I'm working on it.

I am realizing a pattern though, that I have fear related to ANYONE's ""negative"" thoughts towards me. One example is that I texted my neighbor, and her response seemed strangely more brief than usual. I thought ""what if she doesn't like me? what if i made her upset?""  and then i pictured her sitting in her apartment having all kinds of judgments towards me. it made me feel so unsettled in my stomach.   Then, later she texted me again, and I realized everything was fine and that it was all in my head.

Like I said, I keep telling myself over and over that ""people's thoughts are fleeting and don't have much weight and aren't that important and don't mean much"" but I feel like this is just reassurance.

I still worried about it from time to time, but my sex drive and attraction for my boyfriend was coming back in full force, I wasn't checking my attraction to other women nearly as often, and the prospect of being gay just seemed kind of irrational. 

But this week I feel myself spiraling back and it makes me so sad and afraid. I'm in an anonymous Facebook group for students at my university and a few posts have been about people questioning their sexuality recently. Even the simple mention of potentially being gay and wondering how to find out if they're gay set me off. My brain immediately said ""That sounds like you. This is exactly what you're dealing with so you should just face facts."" Also, in one of my classes we read a book that features a lesbian couple. I really loved the novel and found the passages about their sexual relationship really beautiful, but I guess I suddenly realized that I was enjoying and my mind turned that into me somehow being gay (no one would like this story unless they're gay and relate to the characters, you like the lesbian sex in it).

I think it’s a compulsion because it was the first thing I worried about when it stopped working. I tried to remember things I wrote. Things I needed to remember. And I fucking can’t.

I got my phone working for a couple minutes and then it crashed again, but when I got to open my notes I felt instant relief. Like I knew who I was. It sounds weird but it’s very distressing and I’ve been through this obsessive “I don’t actually know who I am” before. I hate it so much.

t2_1kpdas1f,"   Looking back, symptoms of what I now know to be OCD plagued me from a young age (I’m sure a lot of you can relate). But I want to talk about this particular form of it especially. I’m not sure where it came from, but I started having trouble opening new toys and gifts. My go to toy of my childhood was always LEGO, and receiving a new set started to become more and more ceremonious. If it was a set I was looking forward to for a long time or one that I *really* wanted, it would take a lot of willpower and caution to open. I didn’t shred off the wrapping paper like I used to. This is normal *to an extent*, I mean that’s why we have unboxing videos after all. If it’s something you really wanted, you gotta do it right... right? Well, it got a little out of hand as the years went by. I distinctly remember having to lay out paper towel on the carpet to build a particular LEGO set on top of it, in fear of contamination (not necessarily germs and bacteria, but the idea of something new touching something old). Even after I built it, I’d play with it alone and not let it touch “older” LEGOs until that feeling wore off and I went back to being a normal kid. For clarification, it’s only with things that I actually want. Opening a bag of chips or twisting open a bottle doesn’t bat an eyelash for me (thanks teenage appetite).

   Fast forward a few years later, I’m 16 now and the issue has snowballed. The excitement and joy of opening a product that I wanted became replaced with anxiety and dread. Since I’m a bit older, I’ve obviously received more... precious (for lack of better words) things like gaming systems and phones. Expensive and far less frequent purchases like these take even more willpower to push myself to open. It’s not so much contamination anymore as it is just wanting to “do it right”. I have to be feeling good, wash my hands, be at home, and be given time to do it slowly and carefully. Unfortunately the crazy world we live in rarely gives us these luxuries, and it perpetuates the anxiety more and more. The stress of being a teenager with depression, attending an overpopulated high school, going through life changes, and receiving more responsibilities calls for the literal alignment of the stars and planets to be able to do things the way I (or should I say my OCD) truly wants. I mean why would you want to open a new product when you feel like crap? That’s like eating gourmet food off of a plate that just had dog poop on it.

   It’s gotten to the point where I will leave things I was *dying* to have on a shelf for months on end because I didn’t feel ready to open them. The bags and boxes just become decorations that I avoid getting around to. How ironic is that? Over the years my family has gotten more and more frustrated with this as well as the many other forms of my OCD, and I’m sure everyone here knows how crazy it sounds to put your obsessions and compulsions into words. As if I’m not angry with myself over these things enough, my family pressures me to open and use new products no matter what I say. It escalated pretty quickly these days, and they think they’re helping me once I finally start using it. *Of course* I’m going to be okay with using it AFTER the ceremony of opening it, it’s not like I don’t want it, but that just feeds the illusion of them “helping” me. They’ve tried scaring me into it by threatening to return the product, but it just makes things so much worse.

   This is just one aspect of the disorder that has become debilitating for me. Every once in a while I’ll feel a little nugget of happiness and excitement when I remember that *that thing* I’ve been wanting is just sitting there waiting to be open, but it gets drowned out almost instantly by stress.

   However, it’s not all bad news. Over the summer I’ve managed to find the best therapist I’ve ever been to, and I’ve finally started making a dent in my issues. As of right now I can only go once a week; and since there’s so much to fix it’s going to be a long time until I can get some of these things under control. I’ve also been trying new medications with my psychiatrist, but we all know how long that can take to start working. I tell my family that I need to work on this with my therapist first, but they insist that their “do or die” method is best. Just them telling me that I need to open something soon is enough to trigger me these days, or potentially have a panic attack, making it even less likely for me to open my things.

   Does anyone have any advice on this? Whether it’s a mindset to have while opening things, a way to explain this better to my family, something to bring up with the therapist, your experience/journey, a slap in the face to just bite the bullet, etc.? Even words of comfort help, especially since we’re all in the same boat.

   Phew, that went on much longer than I thought it would. Thank you so much for reading this if you did. I just need some extra support right now.

t2_1k53nux0,"I cannot masturbate. Whenever I do, I get these intrusive thoughts, which involve a family member of mine that are indirectly connected to adverse experiences. And the thoughts will be of this person doing things that trigger involuntary responses in me. Usually they are sounds they make that are otherwise annoying but that otherwise trigger an involuntary response. If I was horny, and then this person climbed down the stairs, and I heard that, that's it. If I try to even think sexually, I get intrusive thoughts of this person. The thoughts began coming almost a year ago. They would terrorize my mind for a couple of weeks, then go away for a little while. Then something this person would do would retrigger those thoughts.

I've been on a lot of meds for bipolar and some of them have interacted strangly with my OCD. High dose abilify exacerbated it. I'm on Zyprexa, which at 10mg or less has been OCD neutral, but higher than 10mg and I'm obsessing a storm. I currently take Paxil for OCD and it helps tremendously.

I was put on Wellbutrin for bipolar depression. Worked like a charm but it's doing weird things for my OCD.

t2_15db7sre,"Does this sound OCD related? I REALLY would like a second opinion

I’m not entirely sure if I am able to ask this, so hopefully it won’t be removed by mods... sorry if this is a little long. There is a tl;dr at the bottom.

Within the last year I’ve been diagnosed with both depression and generalized anxiety disorder. From what I can tell I’ve been dealing with this stuff since I was in middle school, and from then it’s been a series of highs and lows. However, the last 2 years have been really rough, and I’ve started seeking professional help. 

OCD was actually brought to my attention by a friend of mine (who is diagnosed with OCD). I remember I was talking about my feelings of unnecessary guilt and the need to incessantly apologize and “fix” it. I would feel the need to apologize or do something in order to not ruin my good relationship with the person. He compared this thought cycle to the OCD circle and since then I’ve been extremely concerned with whether or not I have OCD or not. It’s like a feeling of genuineness and like I’m faking it for the sake of being different or quirky. I’ve done as many online tests as I can think of. When the answer say “yes, you may have OCD” I feel like I’ve over exaggerated my answers or that the conclusion couldn’t possibly be true. However, when it says “no,” I’m not satisfied and try to find another test. I’ve recently started doing this again after someone told me that I was being obsessive, and I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I feel so guilty because of this though, I feel as though I am a bad person for making things up and lying about my mental state, so bad that I’m afraid to mention it to my doctor. 

Additionally, I would say I am WAY to obsessed with my relationship. I do have a lot of feelings for this friend of mine, and nearly every interaction I have with them is extremely anxiety inducing. I always fear as if I will mess up and profusely apologize for things, even if nothing is wrong, or ask if everything is ok, for the sake of feeling as if the relationship isn’t ruined. I feel as though if I say it enough times, it will be fixed. If I ask him enough times and out enough effort into making sure everything is ok, then everything will be ok. I keep stressing over these small flaws in our relationship. Furthermore, though we are not currently dating, we had been previously, and I always make up scenarios in my head to see if we are still compatible, if I still love him, if I’m still aroused by him, if he still loves me, if we would work out in a long term relationship, if we could potentially live together, be married etc. I go down these thought paths and try and plan everything out and make sure that it is still possible. What are your thoughts, is this normal behavior? Am I just in love or am I obsessed with him? Also, I feel as if I were to start seeing someone new I wouldn’t have feelings and would definitely stress out if the relationship wasn’t as “good” or if I could have an ideal perfect relationship. 

Also, I should mention that around the time I was 10-12 I remember having a lot of thoughts surrounding harm. I remember seeing myself stabbing people with knives, scooping eyes out with spoons, a so on... I don’t particularly remember if it caused any significant anxiety or stress though, so I’m not sure if this is OCD either. But it did lead me to think for a decent amount of time that I was a closeted sociopath, which led me again to take a load of online psychopathy and EQ tests to make sure I was functioning normally. Since then, I do feel sometimes that I can have behaviors linked with being a sociopath or a narcissist so I try not to talk about my achievements too much and have questioned others if they think I’m bad or able to work normally, like as a person. Lately though, I feel as though these thoughts are coming back, but every time I think about them I can’t be sure if it’s on purpose to make myself “fit in” with an OCD diagnosis or if they are involuntary thoughts. But what I’ve been doing is repeating phrases to myself to make sure that they don’t happen in real life. For example, this morning I had a feeling that I would be decapitated, so I made sure to cover the back of my neck and say to “please don’t cut off my head” until I felt that it was ok again. That’s just one example, I wouldn’t say I spend multiple hours doing this though, so I’m not sure if it’s indicative of OCD or not. This goes again with, I’m not sure if what I’m thinking is self-induced to purposely fit a diagnosis or if I actually may have OCD, and it’s really driving me crazy. 

Lastly, I’ve had a skin picking habit since before I can remember, and often find that I get lost in doing this and it can go on for quite a long time. I’m not sure if this is an anxiety response or a compulsive thing.

Thanks for reading this if you got this far! I really would like to know if this sounds consistent with OCD or if it just seems like im being performative or fishing for a diagnosis. Whichever answer I get, i probably won’t be satisfied with it and will definitely doubt it and try and make sure if it is correct or not... it feels as if I can never get a rest from this thought... I go completely back and forth, I feel as though I may have OCD, but then the next hour I feel as if it’s all made up in my head and I start to question if I’m telling the truth to myself or not. I’m really having trouble with this. Of course, there are a couple other things that I may not have mentioned in this post, but the ones I did mention are the main ones that have been most bothersome. Thanks again!

TL;DR: I am completely unsure if I have OCD or not. I feel like I am a bad person and a liar if someone/a quiz says I have it because I feel like I’m exaggerating and fishing for a diagnosis. I think I’m obsessed with my relationships and with a specific person and have had harm thoughts in the past which seem to be resurfacing, but I genuinely feel as though I’m bringing these thoughts into my head on purpose for the sake of getting an OCD diagnosis, when I don’t actually have OCD.

t2_4qtltw18,"Hi everyone!! I recently got diagnosed with OCD (mostly pure O). I know with anxiety disorders, it's normal to have anxiety attacks, the symptoms of this being a racing heart, trouble breathing, etc etc. The thing is, I never have anxiety attacks, at least not in the usual way and maybe I cant recognize them(?), but what I do have, sometimes pretty often, is anger attacks. When I get stressed and frustrated I get very very angry and in public I can barely contain myself, I do things like hitting or even breaking whatever is the source of my frustration or whatever I have close (last week I chucked a spatula across the kitchen lol) and if I'm very very nervous I sometimes hurt myself by biting the side of my finger or scratching myself, but have thoughts of really hurting myself. 
Sorry this was kinda long but does this happen to anyone?

But, i want to try to help those with chronic ocd, like me, whom have suffered like me.

I'm  not talking about general ocd, where you can just still go about your life, yet still suffer from it.

I'm talking about the real hard delibelitating OCD, where you feel helpless and are actually

depending on god, which is important if you're rleigious.

I've been to places where most ordinary people, i think, would have killed themselves.

I've ruminated washing my hands so many times ive got burned my hands (basically till i was bleeding-- no skin) where i was washing because i wash my hands with hot water and so on..

id literally go through amazing lengths just to do something i could barely do again to get that

feeling of Oh, i've saved myself by repeating X, which is utterly false by the way.

that helps to discern, i.e. there's no point in repeating what has already been done.

I just want you to note, i haven't seen any psychologists or medical professionals, 

nor have i took medication, i've just tried to get through it.

It's been tough, i'm doing my final 2 semesters of my degree in total. and i've had this ocd for a long time

it arose randomly. it is related to several stress factors and your brain make up etc

but there's nothing importantly wrong with you.

To get to the main point i wanted to help you guys with is, is fundamentally reconstructing your mind

againnst the maladaptive thoughts you have. you sort of have to cold turkey to begin with, but it gets easier.

there's lots of tactics that have worked for me, and the final one, which i'll share helped me in the most.

actually, i'll just say the final one now as that has been the most effective out of any.

this saves you taking medication and actually works if you wholly believe this with everything in your mind.

you have to, essentially, envisage or believe that you're on anxiety medication or you've taken a pill

which makes your anxiety non existent (i animatedly envisage there's a pill in my hand and i do the whole put in mouth and swallow thing -- not essential but helps with placebo). it's here you believe that what's causing your anxiety is just anxiety.

it may be a placebo, but if you fundamentally believe it -- it honestly helps so much.

My ocd is extremely delibelitating, some mnovements in my body (at the moment, by brain and heart) make me ruminate because i feel something has gone wrong in my body  and i feel like

have to do X a million times to make me feel relieved (strange i know).

but the fake administration of an anti-anxiety medication has actually helped.

t2_4u4pimjy,"days ago, some thoughts without my will happened in my head between 2-3 seconds I think. the reason?

ocd was telling me to do a ocd compulsion. it started giving me worries. I did not want to get worried. I predicted something from ocd. a suggestion.

ocd: make a new promise to God not to do the compulsion and then you will be forced not to do the compulsion. you will be happy.

a part of me, when heard that suggestion felt relieved but I told myself and maybe God that ocd is going trap me and what will happen I guess are thoughts without my will and not valid. I even told Him in the past there will be times that some thoughts without my will will try to trap me or affect me or relieve me. no matter how much attention I pay to them. they are not valid.

after ocd made the suggestion, I told myselrf or maybe God that ocd will do its usual stuff and set me atrap. I think I am not sure but I thnk deep inside me I was telling God that these thoughts that are going to follow are not my thoughts.

in the next second, I don't remember why but there is a chance a part of me maybe accidentally, allowed the thoughts about promise without my will to happen in my head.

in the next second, a part of me was like ""oh no thanks to the thoughts without my will I should not do the compulsion. ayay.''

and in the next seconds, I was like ""wait! what happened? no! it is all thoughts without my will and mistake. I do not want them""

ocd: too late! you maybe a part of yours allowed the thoughts without your will to pop up in your head just to use them as an excuse not to do the compulsion in order to relieve yourself from the worries. you should have ignored the thoughts without your will but you pretendted that they happened without your will. you paid attention to them. maybe you forced the thoughts without your will to happen for a second. maybe that made the thoughts valid.

I have told God in the past, that I may somehow be careless for some seconds and may act without my will accidentally or a part of me accidentally act like it is ocd, but the reason this happens is because I know they are thoughts without my will no matter how much I may pretend if I pretend.

I'm worrying about thoughtforms. I saw a woman online who said she has literally seen thoughtforms form in the air in front of her.


I messaged her and she said I have ocd and she replied with this 


Don't be afraid of thought forms. We all make them constantly. If you see one you do not like, just visualize what you do want and replace the old with the new. Otherwise, let them come and go on their own.

Julia Assante PhD

I'm worried I will have to constantly imagine destroying this thought forms as a new compulsion. 

I have a really weird metaphysical obession where I fear I will enter the perspective/mind of someone bad. As mad as it sounds, I saw a video by teal swan who provided a visualization technique on how to do this. And in magick I've seen several visualizations that seem to support this idea. Such as assumption 


""You just visualize your target person (with your eyes open) in front of you, a real living image of the person you wish to match.

It might take you a few minutes to really get into the feeling of them being there. And when you feel that image of them is as real as you can make it, you just physically step into it.

(Of course, to someone watching, you are stepping into nothing but an empty space on the floor)

As you step into that image, now feel yourself as that person. The trick is not to feel yourself as you within them but instead to feel you as that person...there should be no feeling of separation.

If you get it right, you will almost feel like you are not yourself anymore.

And in this state of vibrational attunement, thoughts will pass easily between the two of you, and things that you think you want to do (as them), they will also be thinking they want to do...if they are in a situation where they can be receptive to their thoughts in that moment.

Me &amp; my girlfriend (well, fiancée now) are very naturally vibrationally in-tune so it's quite easy for me (using this method) to pick up her thoughts, or make her look towards me when she is off in the distance across a crowded room, or get in touch when she is uncontactable by normal means.

How you use a method like this is really up to you and your imagination.

It's also a great way to get rapport with someone you wish to like you, for example, at a job interview. You just step into the person interviewing you while they are interviewing you and you'll both seem to be on the same wavelength...because literally you will be :)

Of course, you don't literally get up out of your seat and step into an image of them while they are talking to you, you just do it in your mind...shifting your body slightly in your seat as you merge with them helps a lot to give you the feeling of stepping into them.

This is a very old occult technique that is spoken about in hushed tones in certain mystical circles because there is a fear that it can be used for the manipulation of others. Indeed, these days you'll get many mind-control and romantic/casual datingauthors selling you this basic method for the sole purpose of manipulating others.

You can waste a lot of time with techniques like this making other people do little things for you here and there. Myself, I spent years playing around with this sort of stuff before I eventually got bored of it.

You see, in the end, it's really quite hard work ""manipulating"" others. :)

I put ""manipulating"" in quotes in that last sentence because ultimately you cannot make anyone do anything they definitely don't want to do. Try it if you don't believe me - nothing bad will happen, you'll just end up disappointed. There's a lot of misguided fear-mongering that goes on with people who warn about using techniques like this...and almost invariably those people have never tried these methods and have no real idea how they work anyway...much like in the world of manifesting techniques, in fact :)

What you'll eventually find about using methods like this to ""manipulate"" others is that it's a hard, painful and ultimately un-satisfying way to live your life.

If you think about it, constantly trying to control the behavior of others makes you a slave to who they are, their whims, their ever-changing moods and fancies. A prison guard is just as much a prisoner as the prisoner s/he is guarding :)""

t2_433xt27i,"As i recall, I've pretty much had intrusive thoughts at some point in my life but was never bothered by them. Starting last December i unexpectedly had a horrible thought which led me to believe that i was a bad person who wanted to do horrible things. This was followed by great shame and guilt which made me question myself regularly: Am i a bad person?, what does this thought says about me? Am i a psychopath? What would make a person think this? The thoughts would make me become obsessed for days or weeks at a time as i would try desperately to make it stop. I would spend hours and hours reading about intrusive thoughts and ocd online, then i started to tell my bf about the thoughts to which he said that it was normal and everyone has them. However this only made me feel relieved temporarily. As soon as i got over one bad thought i was hit with something worst. My intrusive thoughts included *what ifs* such as: what if i were a pedophile?, what if i became attracted to my family members, what if i had an urge that i couldn't control? And so much more dark horrible thoughts towards the people who i loved and cared about the most. It became worst when i started to have them during dinner, intimate moments basically anything that made me happy. My intrusive thoughts focused mostly on pedophilia, sexual and harm ocd. At one point my ocd was letting me believe that i was getting turned on by the intrusive thoughts which and me constantly check myself. Never at any time did i enjoy any of those thoughts yet i'd have what you call gronial movements. 
Tips on how i got over my ocd and intrusive thoughts:
1) Do not engage with the thought. You have an odd horrible thought- instead of questioning why you're having them just say what was that and continue doing whatever you were doing.
2) Accept the thought. This doesn't mean you have to like the thought or be okay with the bad thing. Just accept that you had a bad thought and move on.
3) know that you're not alone, we're human and our brain is constantly looking for problems to solve, distract yourself.
4) Understand that these thoughts are just your brain sending signal to you to make sure you're being careful for eg. you're walking down a stair with a knife and have an image or thought about falling and stabbing yourself. The reason for that thought is to let you be aware of what could possibly happen if you're not careful. So to avoid that you would either walk slower or put the knife away.
5) know that the reason you're constantly worried or feel guilty and shame of the thought is because you're afraid if you want to do it... someone who actually want to do any of those things won't feel ashamed or even think about it. 
6) know that you're not a bad person based on your thoughts, your actions and contributes toward society is what really matters.
7) understand that gronial movements because of intrusive thoughts is normal, our brain only needs to hear or think about sex and it would start sending signals to the rest of your body. It doesn't mean that you want do any of thise things or what them to be done to you. 
8)Make jokes about it. 
9) know that when we die we wouldn't be remember for our thoughts ir whatever we have going in in our head. People will remember use for who we really are. The person they can see and know.
10) The most important one for me is EXPOSURE.. for an entire year i stayed away from my nieces because i was afraid i would hurt them.. just a few days after i started being around them ny intrusive thoughts were just thoughts, they didnt matter to me, i realized i wasn't the person in my thoughts, i stopped living in my head and started living in the present. 
Scared of being a pedophile? Go take a walk to kids park and show your self that you can go to the park and not hurt anyone. 
We want to do the exact opposite of our intrusive thoughts, we are not bad people, our thoughts are constantly manipulating us but its been proven that no one with ocd/ intrusive thoughts has ever hurt anyone.  Bad people simply do not care. 
Think of intrusive thoughts as a bully. The more attention you give to a bully the more they will want to bull you, ignore them and they will eventually leave you alone. 
It also helped that i explain to my close family and friends about ocd, intrusive thoughts and what it's like living with it and they were all supportive, said that its normal and nothing worth ruining my life over, and that they know me and the person i am. I do still have intrusive thoughts now and again but they don't make me feel shame or guilty. It's important to understand that Instrusive thoughts are normal and each and everyone of us has but us with ocd just have it difficult to let things go and always need reassurance but let thought be thoughts.

Most people agree what I did was just as bad as I had feared. I really don't know what to do now. There's literally no difference between me and all the other #MeToo shitbags.

Mny on Reddit tried to tell me IT'S ACTUALLY NOT ASSAULT that I was able to move on in an ignorant bliss and resolve to not do that ever again. But now that I know the truth, how am I supposed to move on? After years of calling out assault, I am just as bad. Assault is one of the worst things a man can do.

I considered making a public confession. Some call it ""cancelling."" Shaming and permanently avoiding people who do bad things, usually assault. I agree that is a good thing. If I lose my job, friends, and family, well then, don't I deserve that? If everyone I know abandons me, it's only because I earned it.

After years of being the ""good guy"" even browsing /r/circlebroke and /r/circlebroke2 during the time this happened.... I am the piece of shit I fought against. 

I've also been less than respectful with consent in a relationship with my girlfriend. She says she never felt assaulted, but the fact I had to question that makes me worry. 

At one point, I asked her if she wanted to have sex. She said no. I asked her if she wanted to get nude. She said yes, so I asked her for sex again to which she agreed.

I also once continued getting sexual with her even though I knew I was losing interest in the relationship. Some call this rape by deception.

My therapist tried to explain to me none of it was assault this morning. He remindes me of the time I once had a girlfriend who I wasn't into as much as she was to me. I told him that would be rape by deception and he disagrees. But he's literally describing rape by deception.

He's looked up assault laws to PROVE I didn't assault those women I hugged. He had a hard time, but refuses to just accept it. He copped out by saying **if I'm guilty of assault or rape, 99% of all people are**.

I tried to get treatment for it a little over a year ago, but the psychiatrist I was seeing was not on the same page as me and I ended up trialling many meds that seemed to make my mental health significantly worse. Since weening of the meds and leaving that Psychiatrists practice, I have been completely without psych care and have been just trying to manage on my own. I believe I've been doing significantly better than I was when I was on all kinds of medications, but I am still struggling with all kinds of obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts.

Every night, I get into bed and lay there thinking about death and eternity. I know death is a common theme seen in OCD, but it's not so much the concept of death that I ruminate on, it's the concept of eternity. The fact that time is eternal. It literally goes on forever and there is literally no end to time ever. Time has always and will always exist. There has been a full eternity before any of us existed and after everything and everyone present on earth currently ceases to exist, time and eternity will still exist.

I am not scared to die, and sometimes it brings me comfort to think that when I die I'm just dead and won't even be alive to stress about these things but then I just cannot stop feeling sick about the fact that I am then just rotting in the ground for eternity which will literally never end. I just run myself in circles trying to grasp it all and accept it but the idea of eternity and time being eternal and literally never stopping ever is the most jarring thing and I don't know how to let this one go. I can't see any point in life anymore because I'm like wow I'm just gonna die and rot for eternity anyways. The idea of reincarnation I guess is the least scary for me because then you have the idea of restarting a life and then ending that life and nothing actually lasting forever, but the more I think about it reincarnation scares me too for other reasons and I can't even really force myself to believe it anyways. 

I would go through phases where I'd have these thoughts as a child. Like, these exact thoughts about eternity. I have been upset by the concept and trying to grasp eternity since I was about 8 years old and realized that one day I would die and never come back, ever. Eventually I got through the phases and would accept life for what it is, but as soon as I remember the concept and it enters my brain even slightly I cannot help but falling down the rabbit whole and spiralling about this shit even though there's no answers and eternity is just terrifying.  Its causing me so much stress that as soon as these thoughts enter my mind, if I'm not sitting on laying down I will literally feel the blood rush through me and almost faint from fear. I will be so upset that I'll be pale in the face and need to run to the bathroom to be sick or feel like I'm going to crap my pants. The fear is crippling and now it's to the point where if my brain isn't fully , constantly distracted, I get very scared and upset by this and can't stop thinking about it. I try to sleep with the TV on so that my brain can focus on that but I can't focus on anything but these thoughts and I lose so much sleep laying there sick about this. 

Like I said, I know death is a common theme for OCD, so does this fit into this category? Or is this more existential? Do any other OCD sufferers get these specific thoughts about eternity? How in the hell do I manage it? Its so bad I am genuinely terrified I'll send myself into a breakdown and end up with psychosis or something because my brain literally cannot cope.

*****MAD TRIGGER WARNING***************
******************************************

So I have been diagnosed with OCD for about three years now, but given the way I presented throughout my childhood I've likely struggled with it for longer than we realize. I tried to get treatment for it a little over a year ago, but the psychiatrist I was seeing was not on the same page as me and I ended up trialling many meds that seemed to make my mental health significantly worse. Since weening of the meds and leaving that Psychiatrists practice, I have been completely without psych care and have been just trying to manage on my own. I believe I've been doing significantly better than I was when I was on all kinds of medications, but I am still struggling with all kinds of obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts. For the most part, I manage well and am fairly good at functioning around the OCD, but recently I started having intrusive thoughts that are completely crippling me, and I know I need help before I spiral into a disassociative episode from the constant high levels of anxiety.  

Every night, I get into bed and lay there thinking about death and eternity. I know death is a common theme seen in OCD, but it's not so much the concept of death that I ruminate on, it's the concept of eternity. The fact that time is eternal. It literally goes on forever and there is literally no end to time ever. Time has always and will always exist. There has been a full eternity before any of us existed and after everything and everyone present on earth currently ceases to exist, time and eternity will still exist. It literally N E V E R ends and my brain cannot grasp the concept that things go on forever, that time goes on forever. When you die, you are gone forever. And forever never ends. So you are literally rotting in the ground for eternity and that's so fucked and I can't grasp it like what the hell is the point??!!

t2_4u4pimjy,"ocd was telling me to do a compulsion that I did not want to. I got worries for not doing it. it kept bugging me.

ocd suggested to make a promise to God not to do the compulsion in order to stop myself from worrying. it is a usual ocd trick.

I may have told God or myself that ocd will make thoughts without my will that will relieve me from worries. I have also talked about it to Him many times in the past.

at the next second, I remember I think, myself waiting for the thoughts without my will to happen? I am not sure. suddenly, some words without my will happen in my head like ""promise not to do the compulsion"" something like that.

at the next second, I was ""phew. thanks to the thoughts without my will, I should not do the compulsion""

at the next second, I was l;ike "" wait! no! I do not want this. I did not made these thoughts.''

ocd: you should have ignored the thoughts but you allowed them to relieve you? are you sure they were thoughts without your will?

I am worried cause for a second a part of me, to relieve from anxiety, allowed or forced the thoughts without my will to pop up in my head. I think I was not doing it on purpose. it was just a second. I remember waiting for the thoughts without my will to happen. but I am not sure if I forced them to happen or not. after they happened, I do not why I relieved myself. everything happened in maybe 2-3 seconds? I did not want this.

I wonder fi God made those thoughts without my will valid. I have ocd and my worries are like these. I had many cases similar to this in the past. but I was able between my thoughts to inform God that they were all thoughts without my will. and there is a chance I may act like this just to make ocd leave me alone.

in this case, I do not remember telling God that ocd is going to trap me. I remember informing Him that thoughts without my will are about to happen. and in a second, it was like I let myself fall in the trap of the ocd. I did not want it. my system is so exchausted from ocd, that when ocd finds a fake way out of the compulsions by making promises to God, a prt of me justs relieves itself. but they are all thoughts without my will",ocd analyzer,OCD,1,dqasdz,False

t2_4bkaeg6i,"I have Contamination OCD.  I feel like I've been through some ""traumatizing"" experiences -- after having discovered and now being treated (ERP and meditation) for this condition -- which have left me extra sensitive, fragile, anxious... (I wasn't previously)

I found a decaying animal carcass on side of my house in the grass where my young child will go play someday soon.  I was wearing flip flops and working in that yard.  Yikes!  I also found some wild animal poop a few feet away where I had been working.  (Again, was wearing flip flops)  I then made the mistake of reading about all the horrible things that could be living in the poop, depending on what kind of animal it was (possum, racoon, whatever).  Since then, I've been afraid to go in my back yard, for fear of what I might discover.  The uncertainty and lack of control kills me.

Another time, I found what was likely feral cat vomit on my back patio.  But it could have been something worse.  Who knows.  Disgusting and dangerous??  More uncertainty and lack of control.

Because of these things, just thinking about the outside of my house makes me very uncomfortable and fairly anxious. 

Most recently, we walked through some bat shit on the sidewalk under an overpass, and now I'm constantly ruminating on what could be on the bottom of our shoes (more so than I already did).  I've still not decided what to do about those shoes.  They're sitting in a disposable aluminum pan on my porch, waiting to be discarded, cleaned, or used as-is... 


In summary, these experiences have left me feeling constantly anxious and fragile, afraid of what will come at me at any minute.  Is this just part of the treatment?  They weren't things I intentionally exposed myself to (like in ERP)-- I had no choice in facing them.  

I'm seriously considering giving meds another try.  After 2 weeks on Zoloft, I couldn't bear the anxiety, so I stopped, but a few people have recommended I try Lexapro.

t2_10xjkr,"Hi 

Please let me know if this is not the right sub for this. I am looking for a compassionate way to respond to my mom who has OCD. I'm 28\[F\] and she's 68. 

She compulsively asks questions and jumps from topic to topic. She asks the same questions and doesn't allow room for the other person to speak. She tends to just think of something new if a few seconds of silence follow an answer. It seems reasonable that this is a manifestation of her OCD.

I've said ""can I please have a break from the questions"" and she seems to feel embarrassed but stops for a bit and it seems like she understands intellectually. However, she just ramps right up after maybe 20 minutes or so. 

All of her questions grate on me- I literally feel my throat tighten, stomach turn in knots. I hate these physical effects and the anxiety I feel around her. 

I went to therapy and did a session with her. It went surprisingly well- in it we set boundaries of behaviors I specifically didn't want her to do, but they were more about like ""please do not pressure me to come home for Christmas."" She actually has been good about avoiding these behaviors which helped. However, I am struggling to think of a hard boundary she can follow for conversations with me.

It's also hard on my fiance, who does not feel as comfortable saying ""can I have a break from questions."" I also feel like if I said ""can you give fiance a break"" she might argue back.. it would seem like overstepping (but maybe not).

I have thought of light-heartedly saying ""alright mom let me teach you how I like to have conversations. You ask a question and then wait for the other person to ask a question before you ask one."" It seems heavy-handed and a bit disrespectful, but maybe not.

Any insight would be appreciated.

t2_4x10bepi,"This past weekend I fetched my electric trimmer in order to shave my beard. When I took the trimmer out of its case I decided it was necessary to wash it with water before using it. I made this decision because I had used the trimmer multiple times since I purchased it and I had yet to clean it in any capacity. I recently had a bacterial infection on my skin and I decided that this was a responsible act in order to prevent another one. 

I turned on the faucet and began washing the electric trimmer.  I became anxious before and while holding the object under the faucet because, a few years back, my cousin was unexpectedly electrocuted and he passed away. He was a plumber and was exposed to a strong electrical current when working. I felt personal responsibility make sure that I dried the appliance completely before plugging it in order to completely minimize the chance of electrocution. 

Both subconsciously and consciously I began thinking that I need to be careful because I cannot expose another tragedy to my family. If I plug the trimmer in when it is wet I am increasing the possibility of electrocution and am risking severe injury or death. Such an act would  be careless and negligent and I would not taking the necessary responsibility for my life

These thoughts persisted as I began drying the appliance with a towel. I was compulsively drying the trimmer to try and remove all water. I felt obligated to dry every inch of the appliance. I felt urges to plug it in while I was drying it and I could not follow through with them because of the possibility that those urges were driven by a desire for self-harm or a desire to destroy my family by potentially getting electrocuted. In general I could not be sure that the urges were not completely devoid of malicious intent. 

As I continued drying the appliance and began considering the fact that I may be ready to move on with plugging it in I eventually felt some water on the base of the trimmer. At this point, instead of continuing to dry the trimmer I made the decision to plug it in. I didn't let myself deviate from that decision. I let my body perform the action and plugged in the appliance. 

This was 5 days ago and more often than not since it happened I have been struggling with guilt and anxiety. It is sometimes overwhelming. I blame myself for being negligent and careless when purposefully plugging in an appliance that I felt was still wet. I am taking personal responsibility for taking a potentially dangerous risk. I blame myself for letting the stress and frustration from performing the compulsion cloud my thinking and weaken my resolve to the point where I did not care anymore and thought ""screw it I am just going to plug this in while it still wet"" regardless of the outcome.

I keep thinking to myself, why didn't I just continue drying the trimmer and remove the water that felt was still on it's surface?.

Why did I let frustration and stress enable me to perform what I felt was a risky action? Even if the risk was small I still made a decision in spite of the risk and could have taken further action to minimize that risk.

t2_15db7sre,"Within the last year I’ve been diagnosed with both depression and generalized anxiety disorder. From what I can tell I’ve been dealing with this stuff since I was in middle school, and from then it’s been a series of highs and lows. However, the last 2 years have been really rough, and I’ve started seeking professional help. 

OCD was actually brought to my attention by a friend of mine (who is diagnosed with OCD). I remember I was talking about my feelings of unnecessary guilt and the need to incessantly apologize and “fix” it. I would feel the need to apologize or do something in order to not ruin my good relationship with the person. He compared this thought cycle to the OCD circle and since then I’ve been extremely concerned with whether or not I have OCD or not. It’s like a feeling of genuineness and like I’m faking it for the sake of being different or quirky. I’ve done as many online tests as I can think of. When the answer say “yes, you may have OCD” I feel like I’ve over exaggerated my answers or that the conclusion couldn’t possibly be true. However, when it says “no,” I’m not satisfied and try to find another test. I’ve recently started doing this again after someone told me that I was being obsessive, and I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I feel so guilty because of this though, I feel as though I am a bad person for making things up and lying about my mental state, so bad that I’m afraid to mention it to my doctor. 

Additionally, I would say I am WAY to obsessed with my relationship. I do have a lot of feelings for this friend of mine, and nearly every interaction I have with them is extremely anxiety inducing. I always fear as if I will mess up and profusely apologize for things, even if nothing is wrong, or ask if everything is ok, for the sake of feeling as if the relationship isn’t ruined. I feel as though if I say it enough times, it will be fixed. If I ask him enough times and out enough effort into making sure everything is ok, then everything will be ok. I keep stressing over these small flaws in our relationship. Furthermore, though we are not currently dating, we had been previously, and I always make up scenarios in my head to see if we are still compatible, if I still love him, if he still loves me, if we would work out in a long term relationship, if we could potentially live together, be married etc. I go down these thought paths and try and plan everything out and make sure that it is still possible. Also, I feel as if I were to start seeing someone new I wouldn’t have feelings and would definitely stress out if the relationship wasn’t as “good” or if I could have an ideal perfect relationship. 

Also, I should mention that around the time I was 10-12 I remember having a lot of thoughts surrounding harm. I remember seeing myself with knives, scooping eyes out with spoons, a so on... I don’t particularly remember if it caused any significant anxiety or stress though, so I’m not sure if this is OCD either. But it did lead me to think for a decent amount of time that I was a closeted sociopath, which led me again to take a load of online psychopathy and EQ tests to make sure I was functioning normally. Since then, I do feel sometimes that I can have behaviors linked with being a sociopath or narcissist p so I try not to talk about my achievements too much and have questioned others if they think I’m bad or able to work normally, like as a person. Lately though, I feel as though these thoughts are coming back, but every time I think about them I can’t be sure if it’s on purpose to make myself “fit in” with an OCD diagnosis or if they are involuntary thoughts. But what I’ve been doing is repeating phrases to myself to make sure that they don’t happen in real life. For example, this morning I had a feeling that I would be decapitated, so I made sure to cover the back of my neck and say to “please don’t cut off my head” until I felt that it was ok again. That’s just one example, I wouldn’t say I spend multiple hours doing this though. This goes again with, I’m not sure if what I’m thinking is self-induced to purposely fit a diagnosis or if I actually may have OCD, and it’s really driving me crazy. 

Lastly, I’ve had a skin picking habit since before I can remember, and often find that I get lost in doing this and it can go on for quite a long time. I’m not sure if this is an anxiety response or a compulsive thing.

Thanks for reading this if you got this far! I really would like to know if this sounds consistent with OCD or if it just seems like im being performative or fishing for a diagnosis. Whichever answer I get, i probably won’t be satisfied with it and will definitely doubt it and try and make sure if it is correct or not.

t2_1xd73g0w,"Hi all,

I was on Sertraline (Zoloft) for over a decade for depression/anxiety/OCD, but recently switched to trying Viibryd because of the sexual side effects common to all SSRIs (anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation, decreased libido, etc.). Although Viibryd is also an SSRI, it supposedly has less sexual side effects than Zoloft and the rest.

I started at 10mg for a week, then moved to 20mg. My OCD was not at all as under control as it was on Zoloft, but it seems to me that OCD requires a higher dose of medication to be truly effective as a treatment. Therefore, I increased to 30mg recently, and it seems that move helped me control my OCD symptoms more. I'm considering moving to 40mg soon (the effective dose is considered to be between 20 to 40mg daily) to see whether that provides even more relief.

Anyone else have advice/experience with Viibryd and an effective dose for control of OCD? Unfortunately, while my libido seems less affected than it was on Zoloft, the move to 30mg has brought a return to ejaculatory difficulties. Viibryd has also been causing me very vivid dreams/nightmares regularly, but I'm hoping that subsides soon...",Anyone else on Viibryd for OCD?,OCD,1,dqcri3,False

Hi! I’m a 13 year old girl who just has a couple questions. But to start off, I don’t think this is any form of OCD, but whenever there is a 3x3 Rubik’s cube around that is NOT solved, I physically can’t stop myself from solving it. I get all hot, and the room starts feeling warm. Whenever i solve it, it goes away. But, forget that. 


I have a medically inclined mind, and 
anything medical comes naturally to me. I have some particularly favorite things I like to discuss. One of which is, OCD. 

It’s a path I’m considering studying! I want to be a doctor and help people like you! Now, if it’s ok with you, can I ask a couple questions?


1.) How does OCD affect your daily life?

2.) How or how have you tried to cope with OCD?

3.) When is your OCD most active?

t2_28nca8ng,"To My OCD family,

The cross we bear is heavy. The cards we have been dealt with are harsh. The OCD brain disorder we suffer is annoying and time consuming at its best and brutally punishing at its worst. This doubting disease drives us right up to the edge of our sanity. It leaves us mentally and emotionally exhausted daily and we often become shells of our former selves in the process. The depression we suffer sucks away at our energy and pulls us towards a bottomless and hopeless pit. In addition, there is a lack of awareness in society. Either we are stigmatized for being ""crazy"" or we are told to just get over it. In some cultures, OCD and depression aren't even recognized or acknowledge as real medical diseases. 

I don't know who needs to read this. But I want to remind all of us that we are so strong for enduring all this. For those in the thick of their OCD, you are strong for just enduring all the pain and suffering. Sometimes surviving to see the next day is enough. For those who are working in treatment to fight it, you are strong for confronting your greatest fears even in the midst of crippling anxiety. For those in recovery, keep making the brave and courageous choice to call your OCD out on it's bullshit.

t2_433xt27i,"As i recall, I've pretty much had intrusive thoughts at some point in my life but was never bothered by them. Starting last December i unexpectedly had a horrible thought which led me to believe that i was a bad person who wanted to do horrible things. This was followed by great shame and guilt which made me question myself regularly: Am i a bad person?, what does this thought says about me? Am i a psychopath? What would make a person think this? The thoughts would make me become obsessed for days or weeks at a time as i would try desperately to make it stop. I would spend hours and hours reading about intrusive thoughts and ocd online, then i started to tell my bf about the thoughts to which he said that it was normal and everyone has them. However this only made me feel relieved temporarily. As soon as i got over one bad thought i was hit with something worst. My intrusive thoughts included *what ifs* such as: what if i were a pedophile?, what if i became attracted to my family members, what if i had an urge that i couldn't control? And so much more dark horrible thoughts towards the people who i loved and cared about the most. It became worst when i started to have them during dinner, intimate moments basically anything that made me happy. My intrusive thoughts focused mostly on pedophilia, sexual and harm ocd. At one point my ocd was letting me believe that i was getting turned on by the intrusive thoughts which and me constantly check myself. Never at any time did i enjoy any of those thoughts yet i'd have what you call gronial movements. 
Tips on how i got over my ocd and intrusive thoughts:
1) Do not engage with the thought. You have an odd horrible thought- instead of questioning why you're having them just say what was that and continue doing whatever you were doing.
2) Accept the thought. This doesn't mean you have to like the thought or be okay with the bad thing. Just accept that you had a bad thought and move on.
3) know that you're not alone, we're human and our brain is constantly looking for problems to solve, distract yourself.
4) Understand that these thoughts are just your brain sending signal to you to make sure you're being careful for eg. you're walking down a stair with a knife and have an image or thought about falling and stabbing yourself. The reason for that thought is to let you be aware of what could possibly happen if you're not careful. So to avoid that you would  walk slower.
5) know that the reason you're constantly worried or feel guilty and shame of the thought is because you're afraid if you want to do it... someone who actually want to do any of those things won't feel ashamed or even think about it. 
6) know that you're not a bad person based on your thoughts, your actions and contributes toward society is what really matters.
7) understand that gronial movements because of intrusive thoughts is normal, our brain only needs to hear or think about sex and it would start sending signals to the rest of your body. It doesn't mean that you want do any of these things or what them to be done to you. 
8)Make jokes about it. 
9) know that when we die we wouldn't be remember for our thoughts or whatever we have going in in our head. People will remember us for who we really are. The person they can see and know.
10) The most important one for me is EXPOSURE.. for an entire year i stayed away from my nieces because i was afraid i would hurt them.. just a few days after i started being around them my intrusive thoughts were just thoughts, they didnt matter to me, i realized i wasn't the person in my thoughts, i stopped living in my head and started living in the present. 
Scared of being a pedophile? Go take a walk to kids park and show your self that you can go to the park and not hurt anyone. 
We want to do the exact opposite of our intrusive thoughts, we are not bad people, our thoughts are constantly manipulating us but its been proven that no one with ocd/ intrusive thoughts has ever hurt anyone.  Bad people simply do not care. 
Think of intrusive thoughts as a bully. The more attention you give to a bully the more they will want to bull you, ignore them and they will eventually leave you alone. 
It also helped that i explain to my close family and friends about ocd, intrusive thoughts and what it's like living with it and they were all supportive, said that its normal and nothing worth ruining my life over, and that they know me and the person i am. I do still have intrusive thoughts now and again but they don't make me feel shame or guilty. It's important to understand that Instrusive thoughts are normal and each and everyone of us has them but us with ocd just have it difficult to let things go and always need reassurance but let thought be thoughts.

Then exercise compulsion and very rigid restrictive eating (16 to 18). Then some other random issues.

t2_4xdua40r,"I'm not diagnosed with OCD, but a part of me thinks I have it, because I have this weird thing, where I feel like peoples opinions are always affected by little things, and noone notices. its hard to explain, but for example lets say I realllly like a movie or something, and I tell a friend to watch it, and I keep on telling them to watch it, then eventually they see the movie, and they don't like it. instantly I think that the only reason they didn't like it is because I told them about it, maybe I hyped it up too much, maybe they just subconsciously didn't want to like it because I pestered them, etc. 

I get these thoughts about almost everything, because over the years I've noticed patterns in the way people think, and come up with their opinions. I know that your mood when you do something, affects how you perceive it, but I can't just let it go usually. I start getting a little mad, because I feel like me saying to watch something, should make my friends want to watch it, but instead its just making them hate it. its not just with movies, its like this with literally anything. Movies, Games, Shows, Food, Technology, etc.  knowing I think this way, I usually try to suggest trying something once, and don't press the issue at all, but it seems like nobody wants to follow my suggestions, unless I suggest it multiple times, but then they usually don't like what I suggest, and I cant help but think its because their opinion was influenced wrongly..if that makes sense. 

Another problem I have, is usually when people actually say their opinion, if its a negative opinion, I see nothing but flaws in it..maybe they said it as if it was a negative in this one scenario, but on a different day, they expressed it as a positive view, about something they like, and just didn't remember...I am diagnosed with ADHD, so my mind does tend to think 1000 MPH, but I literally cant stop thinking about certain things, like: maybe my friends all hate me, maybe they just don't want to like what I like, maybe they were somehow influenced by the majority and just conformed, maybe they were just in a bad mood, maybe they just need to experience (X) again....I really hate thinking this way, but I literally in my head argue with the person, and think of everything they would say in specific scenarios, and why they probably just want to hate. 

Now I know this isn't always the case, and I reason with myself most of the time, but to me, if I don't like something, I KNOW its probably because of the mindset im in at the time, because I used to hate practically everything, and upon giving things a second try I usually sway my opinion, what I notice about most other people, is that if they say something, then it is set in stone. I've seen so many people say that they hate (X) when they're like 10, and then all these years later, they still say the same thing, for the same reason...and I just wonder if they even have tried it again since then? Have they just not thought about it, and are so used to saying they hate it, that its just second nature? do they just chose to hate it because it makes them more unique or something? it goes on and on and on in my head, until I finally decide to say something about it to them.

Let me assure anyone reading this, that I think for the most part I act normal in conversation, and i'm usually not very confrontational about my thoughts, but with my closer friends, it eats at me until I say what I think to them. I want to reach some sort of common ground, and I want to understand why they think the way they do. I've gotten into plenty of heated debates over things I'm very passionate about, to the point where I've lost friends. usually of my choice, because the way I see it is, if a friend doesn't like anything you like, you just end up reaching brick walls in conversation, they don't want to relate with you, they don't want to do anything but hate it seems. so I stop talking to them because I cant take the stress of people hating everything.

heres a good example of how a typical encounter like this goes, ill say something like, hey dude, you should check out this show, its really funny, and I love the actors in it. they'll say something like, oh I hate anything with this actor in it, so I don't want to watch it (insert brick wall)   ill say something like, oh well if you look past that, I think you'd actually like this show, its hilarious, and im looking for someone to watch it with. then they proceed to come up with more reasons why they probably wouldn't like the show, instead of actually watching it, and it gets me heated to the point where I tell them I think their opinion is disingenuous, and if they didn't want to hate it, they wouldn't, blah blah blah. this specific scenario hasn't really happened to me, but its a good example of how things usually end up anyway.

I want to know if this might be part of OCD, or if anyone else with OCD has experienced similar things. I genuinely think I have a ""better"" outlook on things, than anyone I know...not to sound selfish, but I just think there's no reason to hate things for these dumb reasons people come up with, and it just feels like everyone just will come up with any reason they can to hate on things... please tell me I'm not alone with thinking this way.",Is obsessing over peoples opinions part of OCD,OCD,3,dqerx9,False

You have to be pretty fast to keep up with your machines sometimes and I make sure that literally I have all of the boxes and labels and even tape ready for next shift. I double everything right away in the beginning, get behind a bit, so that the rest of the night I have time to do small things like fill out my time sheet, sweep my area, etc. Usually I force myself to do this all ASAP instead of doing it throughout the night because I think every single SECOND I have counts and I rush myself to keep myself up while also doing these things all at once. I also have to catch up from giving breaks and if I don't get a break of my own I can accept it but it really unsettles me, my mind makes me feel like everyone else has ""won"" in some way against me, and I can't control that feeling as much as a I try to.

 So I decided to do something. 

If I record myself, in a conversation, I'll listen to it later and relise that, I didn't say anything bad at all. .

But then that actually became my compulsion. It was a huge crutch. I would always have my phone recording what I said, and I haven't even listened to much of what I recorded, it just felt nice to have my phone remember what I said without me trying to REMEMBER EVERYTHING AND OVERLOOK CONVERSATIONS JUST TO MISS THE NEXT ONE MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS IN MY HEAD a conversation behind already maybe.

I started taking meds, and started some self help, and I'm still in the EARLY stages of recovery, I have some really bad days

I decided to just trust what I said, and practice being more mindful and in the moment, I haven't recorded anything on my phone for maybe a week? I have to check. I had no idea when I would get over this. Sometimes when I wasn't recording it would make me disregard entire convos, or I had to repeat myself and be weird. It was crippling.

For several years I have been on clomipramine for OCD. It seems to work well.  We are now raising the dosage, I was on the starting dose for years without noticing. I have the common side effects. I'm sure the list is similar to many other meds.   
I have had one issue over the years. Which has not helped with my agoraphobia and anxiety? The weight gain. Slowly over time, I have gained I would say almost 100 pounds. I try to control what I eat to see if I can get my weight down. In the end, I sabotage myself and graze on snacks and junk.  
Hitting an all-time high with my weight about two weeks ago has made me thing. Should I taper myself off the meds?  I have a strange fear of saying something is ok or not.   
I'm wondering if anyone else has been on clomipramine and was able to lose some weight.  


I have been told by other healthcare members that I just have to go out and for a walk. I always think ""they are right"" I agree to start walking but as far as I get is to the bus stop to drop my son off to be picked up for school. throughout the day I think of the walk. Mainly the reasons I shouldn't go. Too hot, too cold, and fear of just being looked at. stops me.  My wife is thin and feels like I'm the big lumped changed to her leg.

I recently (a few months ago) moved to a new city. I’m from the suburbs and have lived in a small city before, but I moved to a large one about 8 or 9 hours away from my family driving distance. 

My OCD had been well-managed. I’m on an SSRI, had attended therapy for nearly 3 years, and everything felt good as far as OCD was concerned. But when I moved things changed big time. And I know the stress of the move and trying to settle in is probably playing a large part in this but it’s really making me hate living here (and I have to, for at least another two years, for graduate school). 

I just feel dirty all the time. Going out into the world has felt near impossible because I know that when I get back l’ll have to go through various compulsions to get myself to feel clean again (including long ass exhausting showers). I can’t eat or sleep until I shower, either. (And I share one bathroom with 3 other girls so sometimes I have to wait a bit.) My bedroom feels like the only safe spot. 

I’ve finally found a new therapist. It takes me about an hour to get to her office but it’s worth it, I think.

OCD about coloring hair to the point of ruining it

Has anyone else dealt with OCD over hair dye? I feel compelled to dye my hair way more than anyone should. It's thin, dry, brittle and seems to be shedding a lot more than normal. I had natural brown hair for years, but about 2-3 years ago I started dying it and have done it compulsively since. I've been dying my hair a different color roughly every two months since then, but there were times where I did it more often. 

I got my hair done less than 3 weeks ago and I want so badly to color it again. But it's so dry and thin and it really can't take much more. I know it sounds funny, but I just want to go to the store and buy a box of hair dye to make my stupid brain shut up. I think about coloring my hair every single day and spend a lot of time looking at photos of women with crazy colored hair, reading about hair dye, etc. 

At this point it feels like the only solution would be to shave my head. My hair used to be so beautiful and now it's thin and dry as all hell. I really don't know how to stop. There's no way I could go 6-12 months until my hair grows out enough to trim off all the dyed parts. It looks horrible as it grows out.

t2_fm2t5,"Would I say I had a debilitating OCD, yes for a time, but true OCD overall?  No.  But I experienced panic when I never had in my mid 20s, and it started the loop as old as human history when it comes to connecting intrusive thoughts to body or pain signals.  When I experienced that panic it's like it took a snapshot of how my body was engaged at that moment, and linked the two.  Lasted several years, and it still affects me a tiny bit (but we are humans, a good life experiences regular intrusive thoughts too, I believe), but I see it for exactly what it is on all sides, so it means nothing to me.  I realized it was always part of my thinking, it just came to fruition in a bad way.  Now I literally have manual control over how I imagine things, and pretend something pops up, I can just physically and mentally jump past it, even explore it if I want.  I'm very much into questioning myself, but not too much.  Important to do things you don't usually do, to see how you put yourself in a position to experience similar thoughts or tensions over and over.

In mid 20s I was in bad health, just not good.  Mentally, physically.  Decided to spark up a bowl of marijuana, intrusive thought, panic, didn't have the tools, plus bad health...spiral of not being able to help myself.  Never happened before.  And I didn't know what to do, and I hide it.  Just sheer panic for a month that then lasted 2 years in some form.

One thing I learned is that, for me, it was all connected to a bodily tension.  A little NSFW, but it came down to my right side of my body, my teeth (biggie), my arm, my lung, my left side of jaw actually, and my private.  It was my whole body, but some parts were worse than others.  And when you engage something wrong, and it's in pain, your mind uses it a sign that you want to engage the parts of the brain associated with the body part.  So, for example, let's say my private parts were engaged wrong and I couldn't hit the off switch, and it felt like a slow hum of sexual tension (even though it was just tension).  Of course my body is then going to throw out sexual thoughts and pain thoughts together.  It throws out sexual thoughts when my private is engaged in a healthy way.  That's how it works.

And that obviously causes all kinds of bad body signals and loss of control over yourself.  You are the vessel, and that's important to remember.  Your body should not feel like a stranger, it should feel like...you.  Every inch of it.

And I learned that those physical cues were actually just straight up pain or my body yelling at me to reengage certain muscles.  Especially my lungs and diaphragm  (which maybe has something to do with the marijuana?).  Once I learned it had to do with facial tension, not engaging my diaphragm properly for my lungs, I just worked on it.  Now I engage my body in such...neutral ways...sometimes I feel like I'm high on something, because the way I feel myself I've never experienced before.  Just pillows of air.  I used to breathe literally through my nose, now I breathe from my diaphragm, so my awareness is in my torso, and not in my head.  It's amazing how everything I've experienced is based on what body tensions I chose naturally.  I've never felt the way I do now.  It's why we're all so different, but our bodies are very similar.

What I found is that the exact tension I would go into during OCD days or moments, would relieve itself in exactly the right way when I relaxed properly.  Let my body go into autopilot mode correctly.  There's insane luck involved when trying to reengage muscles you haven't engaged in a long time...you need to put yourself in situations where it can happen.  Remember you are built as a human being to use all your muscles all the time, when you don't they will tense up on you over periods of time, trying to get the exercise they want.

As bad as it all was, it taught me a lot.  And I think it propelled me to a place I wouldn't have gotten to otherwise.

Also i hate darkness. Like its weird, over the last couple of months, i’m like anxious of dark rooms, or just generally when i’m in my room, i always have the light on, i hate sitting in darkness, even if theres a tv on. 

And i always think about what other people are doing, and kind of compare that to me, like i’m not doing enough, or they are doing something more interesting than me.

On a normal day at home, my OCD will consist of moderate handwashing and number counting.

If I’m leaving the house, I have three bags I have to take with me all packed with mostly clothes and other random odds and ends I don’t need (bags include my big purse, small backpack, and a plastic Walmart bag). I also have to bring my two jackets, and all my plaid shirts and hoodies (that I use as light jackets, there’s five overall). If I don’t bring all these things, I will have a panic attack.

I also have to jiggle doorknobs, flicker lights, do a weird thing around mirrors that I simply don’t know how to explain, and pet my pets a certain number of times before I leave. This process starts the night before, I do the packing and filming before bed. Everything else I do in the morning (Including lugging three heavy bags up the stairs and putting them in the car). MY OCD started 6 years ago when my sister died, that’s when my anxiety got intense and steadily got worse until moderate agoraphobia developed as well.

I’m doing self-administered exposure therapy for my anxiety/agoraphobia. It’s been a grueling process, but I’m am slowly getting better. The OCD has been harder for me to tackle. The OCD causes more panic, and honestly, it’s an aggressor of my mental state.

I’m currently making very little money, and I don’t have insurance. I go to MedLink for my prescriptions, 25mg Hydroxyzine is all I take for anxiety. I can’t afford therapy, but I want to try at home ERP. I made my own compulsion/ritual habit version of the [“CBT Techniques: 5 Steps to Stop Worrying”](http://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/5-steps-to-stop-worrying) questions, that I’ll answer in the hope it’ll help.

I’ve been diagnosed by my normal doctor, so I’m not looking for any medical advice or a diagnosis. I’m looking for any personal advice or stories on controlling compulsions and at home ERP.

t2_4ik8xbfr,"I was working up until September. A few days before my ""accident"" I started thinking about every swallow I had. I was googling things like ""dysphagia"" at work, trying to ease my mind. I became worried that I would start choking on food and in my sleep. The day before my ""accident"", I literally laid down on my bed and started drooling onto a napkin like an idiot. 

I had other problems at the time. I had very bad neck pain for several months. I was sleeping less, like a lot less. Because of my insomnia my heart rate would randomly skyrocket when I walked. 

Day of my ""accident"" I decided to go to an ENT, who suggested going to the hospital because of my heart rate. I said yes and ended up in an ER. I thought I was ""safe"" ER asked if I wanted the procedure the ENT would do and I said yes. So for 20 minutes they put camera through my nose shoved it down my throat. It was painful. I really regret it. I don't know what they did it in there. Biggest mistake of my life.

The next few days I went in-patient at a mental hospital because I felt like I had completely lost control of my life. They didn't help me at all, it was pretty traumatizing. My blood pressure was high, and I felt like I was having a heart attack everyday. Things didn't settle down until I saw my old psychiatrist and took seroquel, putting me to sleep.

Since my procedure, I feel like I have to strain to use my voice, and I get throat pain from time to time. It's better than it was 2 months ago, but I kick myself everyday over what I've done.

I've been on zoloft again, and some antipsychotics and benzos from time to time. I'm not working anymore and staying at home 24/7 with my parents.

I feel like I can't talk, and often I feel like laying in bed (and sometimes drooling) just to give myself some escape, like an 80 year old with dementia in a nursing home. Yikes. This isn't where I imagined my life to be going 6 months ago.

I've seen 2 ENTs since who found everything to be normal. And I saw speech therapist who wasn't concerned. I just wish I felt normal and unconcerned myself.

Oh the neck pain is gone, funny how that works.

I've had a few therapy sessions since to try to get me to reframe my toxic thoughts, and get better judgement so I don't end up getting more unnecessary procedures.

I feel like I'm disabled now, and that my life is changed permanently. Yes I have 2 arms and 2 legs that work, and ""look"" fine. But I just can't stop thinking about swallowing sometimes, and I feel like I can't talk without pain. Sometimes when I eat my throat hurts a little. So I'm pretty much ""triggered"" all the time.

t2_54qid20m,"Multiple possible triggers abound in this post. I'm new, and since I'm getting my very first psychiatric evaluation tomorrow, I wanted to share some of what I've been experiencing these past few months; if for no other reason just to feel less like an alien suffering in silence. Since my brain is screaming at me not to talk about my obsessions on this sub, that's *exactly* what I'm going to do.

So I haven't been actually diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, and it's why throughout this post I want to refer to my troubling symptoms as ""obsession(s)"" instead of ""my OCD."" However, I would be extremely surprised to be told, after a proper evaluation, that I DON'T have this disorder. The hand washing until my skin cracked and bled when I was 14 was the most obvious obsession I've had, but I've come to realize through reading here and research that most of mine have been the unseen type.

I don't want to make this too long and rambling so I'll get with the current issues I've face during the past two months. It started back in late September with a sudden, severe panic attack. I had to go to the ER. The panic began when I noticed an odd sensation in my head that I have a hard time describing, but I got this thought something like ""I'm about to lose touch with myself and I won't make it back"" and it sent me into the attack. As you can probably guess, days after that it became my obsession.

It's vague, but the best I can describe it is it's this fear that my brain can ""shutdown"" almost like a computer. There isn't much rationalizing going on with the fear, but ultimately when I ""ask"" the obsession how this would be possible it simply says because my brain will be shut off by my own troubled thinking and anxiety. I told off this obsession and it actually left for all but two weeks. Next thing I knew I was obsessing again after reading about repressed memories due to trauma. A similar theme to the ""shutdown"" theme emerged; this time taking the form of pure mental anguish could make me go crazy.

That theme stuck around a week and then evolved into something extremely bizarre. It evolved after I kept telling it that those things I read were theories and that any mental problems are treatable. Next thing I know the obsession tells me that it can't be treated because my brain is going to start becoming afraid of literally everything, even treatment.

This fear of everything then soon faded on its own, only to leave a vague, all consuming ""threat"" in its place that I'll never be able to be happy or enjoy myself. And at that I'm done describing these past two months of evolving themes because it's getting long and exhaustive. Basically what's going on now is the shutdown theme made its way back after returning during a panic attack last night, and I've lost almost all ability to cope with it.

I don't even know what's going on in my head right now. I feel distant, like I'm floating outside of myself. I'm also developing this fear that I'm going to start distrusting anything I think about because all my thoughts do is turn into obsessions for one reason or another. I feel like a stranger in my own MIND. I honestly don't expect to get an OCD diagnoses anytime soon since I'm using an assistance program to get any treatment to begin with, and I'm in a small town with not many specializing in anything; much less OCD. I'll probably be told like I am when I go to the ER ""oh you've got some anxiety so go outside more and maybe have an Ativan to help you for now.""

What follows may also sound like a joke but I promise it's not and I'm genuinely reaching out for help. Also I'm starting here before the doctor or anything for a few reasons but mainly because of uncertainty.
So I've had social anxiety for a long long time and I'm currently 16. I know that when left untreated (which I have been doing literally nothing in terms of medication and therapy) that anxiety can develop into OCD but (this is the embarrassing part) I watched The Aviator which is one of my favorite movies. if you haven't seen it it's about Howard Hughes a very brilliant who suffered horribly from OCD and after I watched the movie I would sort of ""mock"" him. Not as a joke but because it entertained me if that makes
 sense.. like I'd repeat the same phrases he would because I like the way it sounded or thought it was cool. Anyway I did some basic research on ocd (looking at the first thing that comes up) and at the time the only thing I shared with the disorder was Intrusive thoughts. Okay so some time goes by (maybe a few months or less) and I'm thinking about the possibility of having OCD constantly. I take an OCD test online to see if I should see someone for help and it says I have a strong chance but I doubted that because it was an OCD test online and like I said I don't self diagnose. Recently or within these last two months I've been noticing some symptoms coming up. I started twitching my eyes last month sometimes just because I didn't like the way my eyes felt at the moment but other times involuntarily. I've always sort of ""cringed"" or scrunched my face up when thinking of something horrible or stupid so I think that's excused. Today I started twitching my head off to the side. I keep telling myself I'm trying too hard to be like Howard Hughes and that's its not cool to have OCD but it seems the symptoms keep coming on no matter how many times I repeat myself. The thing is earlier I mentioned I kept thinking about OCD repeatedly so is it possible I'm giving myself OCD? I don't have any rituals besides playing the same songs as I sleep but I genuinely love those songs and even sometimes fall asleep to other things. To an extent I do hate germs and hate when people touch me but I believe there's nothing odd about wanting to be clean however I should consider this a possible symptom. I've thought for a while bringing my own soap to school is a great idea (the school soap makes my hands dry and they look ugly). I'm really just trying to say everything that could be a possibility. I also today had started to repeat phrases much more than usual. Sometimes phrases get stuck in my head like ""just fix it sir"" from punch drunk love so I'll say it out randomly along with other quotes from places or people. I started clearing my throat more aggressively or became more aware maybe.... um I have maladaptive daydreaming which is the one thing I self diagnosed (its not regonized yet). Which is basically for me when I get lost in my daydreaming for 5 or 10 minutes at a time and anxiety in general (maladaptive daydreaming is a symptom of anxiety) is ruining my life. It's always been extremely hard to connect with people and I often listen to others conversations and get happy because they put words together in a satisfying way. I have acquaintances. I act stupid in public so my anxiety is not the worst but it stops me from doing A LOT of things normal people do. For example I've had an obsession with this girl for about a year but it paralyzes me to even think of talking to her. I'd say she's what I think of the most when it comes to thinking of people. My intrusive thoughts consist of (daily) violence - me going through old arguments and hitting people instead of talking... hitting the girl I mentioned previously for no reason.
embarassing myself - saying something stupid in front of people or blinking the wrong way or doing any small thing for me to be called out on.
bad sexual thoughts - um I don't want to go into this one because it's just too embarrassing for me to talk about all of this in general. I've thought about posting here for a while but I'm afraid someone in my real life could possibly know it's me. But with these new possible symptoms surfacing it's time to reach out for advice. I'm also sometimes hypersensitive to sounds and just certain dumb things like hearing people eat which will get me very frustrated. I'm really trying not to leave anything out here.

What I'm asking for is someone to tell me yes or no. Should I see a doctor or not. Speak objectively please. don't say ""well I think"" because I want to be absolutely sure of this thing.

t2_4v2jo20e,"What’s up reddit fam, fellow individual here diagnosed with OCD. I have been on meds (Prozac) and therapy for a little over a year now. Just wanting to get some things off my chest especially at times where I feel like there’s no one I can relate to. I hope somebody can read through it all and that it doesn’t take up much of your time :)

A bit of info on myself is that I’m an 18 year-old male first-year engineering student straight out of high school. I’m very introverted to the point where I isolate myself and refuse to see people until I have become the person that I “want” to be. I haven’t been going to school recently except just showing up for labs and exams.

The purpose of me making this post is that I have some habits that have been eating at me despite being in therapy trying to stop them for over a year. I understand they are very shallow and I am trying my best to stop them.

1. I walk around my living room in circles for hours in a day (collectively, not simultaneously) listening to music and daydreaming. I get hyped up where I’m imagining myself as an alpha male living the ideal life I wish I had. This includes me being surrounded and talked about with women and respected amongst my peers, having lots of money, wearing designer clothes, being the child of wealthy affluent people, a basketball star, etc. Think of Fight Club where Edward Norton created this character he wishes he was if it helps you understand what I’m taking about.

2. My OCD makes me either insanely insecure or extremely egotistic. I have become a shopaholic spending thousands of dollars buying designer clothes because I feel like people will judge me for wearing normal Nike’s or even eating in a cafeteria. I used to be made fun of as a kid for wearing the same clothes every day, and now that I’ve earned money by hustling, the only way that I can ever be myself is if I’m seen in designer clothes. That’s because then I feel like people will think “Wow look at him, he got style” and then it doesn’t really matter what I do at that point because I’m “that cool guy” with designer clothes. When I’m wearing “normal” clothing, I get panic attacks for even just walking in public. But then when I wear designer clothes, I feel like I want the entire world to look at me. There’s never a middle ground where I can go through my day normally and not care about looks. 

3. I constantly ruminate and spend hours trying to convince myself I’m not a pedophile, a rapist, a racist, and etc. for simply having intrusive thoughts that convince me I am otherwise. I’ve had experience with women and I have never forced any action beyond their consent. I may have done a little “cmon babe it’ll be fun” at times, but never to the point where they said no and I did it anyway. I always made sure there was a yes before any action I took. Yet simple things like this affect me for months on end and makes me feel like a rapist. I’ve never said the N word to anyone or excluded someone because of their beliefs/appearance, or had any interest ever in pre-pubescent children.

t2_xahil,"My obsessions are about bad things happening to people I love, and my main compulsion is checking the time to see if there is a 6 in it. I only look at the last digit, the hour doesn't matter.  

So I'll say ""if there's no 6 in the time everything is fine"" and a lot of times there would be a 6.  

Sometimes I change it to another number, sometimes I say ""if it changes to 7 now, its true"" and it will change to 7.  

I'm convinced something bad is going to happen, something specific and I cant stop thinking about it.  

I'm having trouble knowing its ocd and not a superpower to prevent things from happening.  

My ocd wants me to agree to this thought and ""give up"" my mom or sister.  

I've been fighting every day and it's so hard.  

I worried that these thoughts are intuition and not ocd, that my gut is trying to tell me things, and when I check the time it's like it confirms the thoughts.  

I've had coincidences before 
- I got in trouble for piracy and was afraid of going to jail so my ocd said ""you won't go to jail but your boyfriend will break up with you"" so I agreed, and I didn't go to jail and he broke up with me.  
- My aunt called one night and said she didn't know how long my grandma had to live. I was playing the sims and trying to starve the old people. My ocd said ""if you do it your grandma will die"" I ignored it and she died the next day.  
- Today I said ""I'd rather have my glasses break than lose my mom or sister"" today I accidentally broke my glasses  

There are other coincidences but I'm not allowed to talk about them.  

But these thoughts feel so real and I'm worried that its intuition and that something is trying to tell me something, like sometimes it feels like I'm grieving in advance.   

I just need someone to convince me its ocd and typing this right now my ocd is saying ""you know it's not ocd""  
I feel so numb and I feel like I accidentally agreed to letting these thoughts happen.  
It almost feels like I ""gave up my mom"" and I'm scared because of the other coincidences and I'm just so defeated and I dont know what to do.  
Every day I feel like this but never this much, maybe it's because I accidentally agreed by failing a compulsion and not fixing it or because every time I look at the time it's a number I say it cant be (3 6 or 9) so it's like the time is telling me there's nothing I can do about it.  

I use the time as a yes or no thing.  
Bad number = it's true  
Good number = not true  

But I'm worried about people I love, and the specific worry I have isn't for both people, just one, and my ocd tries to tell me it's my mom, then I say no, then it says my sister, and I say no, but it feels like it's trying to get me to accept one fear to prevent the other. ""your mom and your sister won't die, but you'll go to jail""  

I just need someone's opinion and hopefully with similar obsessions. I know reassurance isn't good because its counter active but I'm not in therapy and not ready for exposure.

t2_54yvifhj,"I (m18) have been lost and confused and I don't know what's going on. I don't know if I'm gay or bi or straight, or in denial, and it's been keeping me awake sometimes.

Ever since I was young, I was always attracted to girls. I get nervous around them and would dream of being with them, I would masturbate to them and would sometimes watch porn with them. I have a girlfriend I'm madly in love with and I'm attracted to her both romantically and sexually. It's worth noting that we started having sex around two months ago.

I also remember how I watched a movie a few years ago, and how it contained a gay sex scene. I thought that it must feel good being on the receiving end. Ever since then, I would sometimes think about gay sex during masturbation. Once or twice I tried to do stuff to myself down there, but I didn't like it. I never had any sexual or romantic attraction to a guy, however.

However, a month ago I seriously wondered if I was gay. I thought about me sometimes thinking of these things while masturbating, and I also thought about me being nervous around girls and not nervous around guys (I thought that I felt more comfortable with guys as a result). I started to panic as I had a girlfriend and I didn't want to lose her.

Ever since then it feels like I lost my attraction to my girlfriend, both romantically and sexually. I'm scared, as I do not want to break up with her, and I want to stay with her forever. Previously I was super attracted to her and would sometimes immediately get hard thinking about her, but now I don't. I saw a Reddit thread asking when gay people knew they were gay, and one guy commented that he tried sex with women and didn't like it. I thought about me trying sex just a month ago and started to freak out more, and i thought I didn't like it. I do get hard around her, but when I put a condom on, the erection disappears and that makes me more scared. It feels like now I can only get hard with her if she starts playing around with me, and it doesnt come naturally. I'm scared that I lost interest in her because I tried sex and I'm afraid that I don't like it for whatever reason. 

When I masturbate, I now only think about gay sex, which I despise. I keep getting thoughts - you are gay, you should break up with her because you are gay, you want to have gay sex, you don't love your gf anymore, you would love being at the bottom (despite me trying it to myself and not liking it). I'm scared because I don't want to be gay and I want to be with my girlfriend. It feels like I lost almost all of my attraction to women and it feels like my libido is at zero. and previously, when my gf went on a trip, I would miss her so much, but I don't feel that now and I'm scared. I just don't want to be gay, but I'm scared I am.

I made the stupid mistake of watching gay porn last night to see if I was aroused, and after the first minute I saw that I had  a bit of an erection, which did not help at all and made me panic. I thought of gay and straight encounters and tried to see if I was aroused or not aroused. When I see a picture of a man, I sometimes feel like it twitches down there, which I don't get with women now. Worse, when I see a man, I sometimes even think that I am holding back my erection. It feels like I get more aroused thinking about this than thinking about my girlfriend, which makes me worried.

Does thinking about gay sex while masturbation make you gay or bi? Does me being kind of aroused to gay porn make me gay or bi? Is losing attraction (both romantically and sexually) to females a part of hocd? Is this all a part of hocd or not? Am I gay/bi or in denial?

t2_1frpzpdn,"For most of my life I've struggled with tons of insecurities, some more intense than others at different times. At a time when they were especially bad, I started doing OCD rituals(I didn't know what it was at the time). After a while, others started complimenting me on the parts of myself I was and am insecure about. I felt much better about myself, I guess I think/thought the OCD caused others to view me differently, or for me to change for the better. I kept up the OCD, as to not become insecure again, and soon it got to the point where it was all I thought about and my family were extremely concerned. I was not at all functional, doing pretty disturbing looking and instance rituals for hours.. I started on Zoloft, and slowly I got better. The thoughts and rituals decreased, but others started to make fun of things I was/am insecure about. This kind of told me that if I stopped the rituals, I would feel more insecure and the things I was insecure about would be more intense. That's the point I'm at now. Its been over a year and a half since this all started, and at this point maybe I have to choose between insecurity and OCD. Even though I partially know its all bullshit, the effects feel so real.

t2_2jbepcdz,"I feel like I'm at the end of my line here. Ever since I was a kid I had obsessive tendencies (my parents called me tunnel visioned all the time and said I got stuck on stuff constantly) such as pulling out my hair to relieve anxiety, and having to sit in the exact right place to do homework or id have a meltdown cus it didnt feel right. As a teen and into my adult years my anxiety got worse, and I would have to constantly check the weather every day probably 20-30 times a day to feel safe, and often would feel compelled to tell others about it. If there was a storm coming, I would have to check a lightning tracking app probably every 2 minutes to feel any anxiety relief over and over. As I got into college I started to develop intrusive thoughts, such as what would happen if i stabbed my cat, drove off the road with my brother, fell off a bridge, killed myself, and even ones about reality. In sophmore year everything spiraled and the intrusive thoughts started to cause panic attacks so intensely that I'd get tunnel vision. I would be constantly preoccupied with trying to find out what's wrong with me, because I was terrified, as I have never experienced this level of anxiety and knew that those things I thought were very uncharacteristic of me and nothing I'd ever do. If I went to class, often times in my mind a thought would pop up saying ""someonws gonna come in and shoot us all"" and then my heart would race and id get dizzy and the only way to fix it was to leave. And eventually stop going. As things got worse I got so fixated on having a mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar that I set up multiple psych evals and for each one I'd be panicking until the very moment I finished them, and after felt immediately relieved until the anxiety came back. This led me to have crazy thoughts such as ""is any of this even real"" or ""red seems to be a color that makes me fearful so I should get rid of red things"" (which i did. I changed up my rooms design). But the thing is even though these thoughts came up repeatedly, I KNEW the whole time they weren't true, but still couldnt stop getting stuck on them and I always was preoccupied with finding a way to get rid of those feelings.

The biggest obstacle involves learning subjects. It’s funny because I used to (and still do) fail a lot of grade school and uni classes. This was not because I had trouble understanding, not because I couldn’t motivate myself to study. No, this was because I was so obsessively focused on categorizing the information I became like stone and could not learn the rest of the material. 

The reason this has been a strength is because I can learn one type of information very well. I could be an excellent chemist, painter, physicist, electrician, if I pick one, because my brain has an easier time organizing the fields substructure rather than trying to formally align it with other unrelated subjects. I’ve done well in those subjects and I tend to like most subjects both involving humanities and STEM.

I can’t enroll in 5 classes and just go from class to class, take notes, study, do a test. I will get stuck on the first few notes, trying to write them exactly in a highly streamlined way, or understand how my art history notes have any degree of lexical and structural similarity to my physics notes.

t2_q7kfjlz,"In celebration of 2018 and all the progress I made with depression, I decided 2019 would be dedicated to coping with anxiety. For me, anxiety has always been a more subtle and covert emotion than depression, thus making it harder to deconstruct and work through. When I'm depressed, it's very obvious to me, but when I'm anxious, it can be hard to pinpoint because of how long I've lived with it (it feels normal) and how it tends to hide, expressing itself through other emotions. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, I decided to get to work and start brainstorming the ways I can detect my anxiety and understand what exactly causes it. I've learned that when I want to work on things like anxiety, depression, etc. I have to dig in head-on. This led me to a TED talk by therapist Brene Brown called ""The Power of Vulnerability"" and she discusses her professional and personal findings on shame, fear, guilt, lack of self-confidence, and vulnerability. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, after some soul-searching, I've realized I have a deeply-seated lack of self-confidence and this realization has utterly shaken me to the core. It's as if I've spotlighted anxiety, hiding in the bushes all this time, and by doing so, I've elucidated how much it affects facets of my life. I realize now why I fear relationships (friendly and romantic) and affection, yet deeply long for a partner and feel pain when I see my two closest friends together, dating. I realize how much I place my own self-worth in the hands of others and subsequently, why I struggle to be content in my own company. I realize how much I live off of affirmation from those around me and how truly inferior and lacking I feel to my peers.

&amp;#x200B;

This massive realization has utterly ruined me for the last two days and I just ask for some support, advice, and comforting words please, at least to hold me up until Wednesday, the day of my therapy appointment. I'm experiencing so many emotions at once-- grief, shame, fear. What were once quiet hums have turned into booming, overwhelming thunders and it's so difficult to cope. Every small thought transforms into a giant spiral of negativity and catastrophization. I've had to quit playing Minecraft, a game I find calming and soothing, because simply the \*thought\* of messing up a house and having to start over makes my chest tight. This is hell.

t2_qqcsl,"As the title of this post says, today I've had the epiphany that the whole New Year celebration triggers me. 

It's not the people (I've learned to deal with big social gatherings a long time ago. I even enjoy them, if all the people in the room are from my inner circle). It's not the pyrotechnics or fireworks, I love them actually. It's common to believe that what triggers me is how overwhelming all of it can be, especially since I am diagnosed with Social Anxiety. But no, it's not any of it. 

You see, I have a terrible fear of failure. I always feel like I'm not doing enough. Like I'm wasting time. Work hours are never enough. Hobbies and activities to keep me occupied are never enough. I always have too much free time, no matter how exhausted I feel. 

People wait for the new year in hope of new things, new experiences and with the hope that the year to come will be better than the previous one. The new year is perceived as a new opportunity to start over, to do better, to try again, etc. 

But to me is just a gigantic reminder of how everything I'm doing is not enough, how the time is still passing, not stopping. Another year has gone by and I haven't done enough. And don't be confused, I always have that feeling, those thoughts, in the back of my head, every day. But today, it's insanely intensified, it's burning through every other thought or feeling and I can't seem to ignore it. And I know the change of year is just another date on the calendar, my logical thoughts remind me this. But my anxiety is just standing there, tapping annoyingly on her wrist watch, reminding me: ""tik tok"" and it's so loud. 

Social media only makes it worst. Seeing all the people celebrating and expressing how excited they are to what's to come and stuff like that. I already logged out of everything for today after the first 4 or 5 posts lol.

t2_1namrmmo,"Some people came over to my house today for New Years. I really dislike them, they're honestly really annoying, but whatever. My family invited them. The guests have 2 kids, and one of them is a real asshole. He shot my younger sibling in the eye with a Nerf gun, and got no discipline. A few minutes later after that, a family member asked to borrow some game I had to play with the annoying kid, which I proceeded to decline the offer. They proceeded to rant me, saying ""you're embarrasing everyone."" They took it anyway, and I started crying in my room, alone.

I have had anxiety for about 5 years now. I am extremely sensitive to things, and will cry very easily, as I have an extremely short temper.

I don't know what to do. I'm always upset. Can I just have a bit of motivation? Sorry if I ranted.

t2_b4ivy,"I can get really bad anxiety when it comes from girls I like. But what I'm going through is worse than anything I had before.

There was a girl I really liked earlier this year. She means a lot to me and she helped shaped who I am. I fought my anxiety and asked her out. She said no and never said why. I had a hard time taking it because I didn't know why. I couldn't be able to go to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about why she didn't want to go on a date. I would only sleep because of mental exhaustion. I eventually burned my self into depression. At that point it was no longer about this girl, but depression taking over my life. Depression telling me I was  worthless, no one  cared about me, and that I  was going to be alone forever. I almost ended my life. My boss was the only person who checked up on me,even though I didn't tell him what I was going through depression. He used to call me in to work but not to work, just to talk. He helped me get out of depression and told me I have to push her away to heal, and I did that and I got better quick. My boss also helped me in learning how to pick up other girls and I went on a bunch of dates. I feel like I owe him a lot for the advice and helping with my depression. 

When I felt better I brought back the girl again. Initially I thought I could just see her as a friend. I told her why I needed space and time. She understood, she is incredibly nice person. I found out she did like me back but she was scared of commitment at the time. We started to talk and hangout again. Two months go by and I started to like her again.

I was scared to be in the same situation again so I told her I can't be her friend. I told her I can't be her friend because it would kill me if I saw her with someone else and that I don't even want to know if she is talking to someone. I told her I couldn't be in a relationship because it would have been long distance and I would start filling In the blank because of my anxiety. She understood and ended the conversation saying ""you every hear stories of people who are perfect for each other but couldn't be together because of timing and situation, I think that's us"" 

The next week was weird because I kept getting stories upon stories of ""the one who got away"". I've been dating for a couple of months and I didn't like any of them. I think I went on 20+ dates this year and about 6 relationships. One of them cheated on me and no one clicked. I got extremely scared that this girl would be the one who got away, and I at least need to try. So I went to talk to her and that I wanted a date. She used to like me, she said she likes spending time with me and talking to me, she said talking to me was different from anybody else. 

She couldn't go on a date because she was talking to someone she meet in college. She didn't tell me that, because I told her I didn't want to know if she had someone because I would get hurt. I did get hurt. That's why she said ""you ever here stories of people who are perfect for each other, but can't be together because of timing and situation"" She said she almost wants me to wait for her because she does want to try something, but they are committed and she doesn't want to put me in that position. And to be honest I would put myself in that position.

I spent all day at work thinking about what could have happened, what I could have done, if I worked harder to be in same college, the fact that she was scared to commit to me but she can't date me because of commitment, and many more things. We were getting busy at work and my family kept harassing me about something too. My chest hasn't gotten this tight since a long time. I went out to give my therapist a call, but the local business got mad and was yelling at me saying I was smoking and I ruined his lunch (I do smoke but never near his business, trying to quit though) I cracked and I started to have a panic attack. 

My boss stopped the man from yelling at me, told me to take a break, and eventually went to find me to talk to me. He took me to lunch and I explained anxiety to him and depression. And he understands what I'm saying more than my friends or family. He made me realize I was over thinking a lot of this. And I guess yeah I need time to heal but he is putting me on the right path again. 

He is an amazing person. He hired me to be a mechanic even though I didn't know anything about cars and didn't have any tools but I told him I desperately need a job with flexible hours. He motivates me to stay in stay college, even when I wanted to drop multiple times. He hasn't fired me even after the countless times of me fucking up. I'm grateful that he is my boss.

It all started between 2017 and 2018.

The next day I woke up with a bump behind my ear (pretty sure its an enlarged lymph node, or could just be bone that’s been there the whole time.

I wouldn’t be as worried but whenever I look up “bump behind ear” it usually says it “goes away on its own in a few months” and it’s been almost 2 years?

t2_iafhl,"So I’ve struggled with depression for a decade and had it mostly under control, but recently, I think I can officially say that I have some serious anxiety. This is new- ive struggled with “surface level” anxiety many times, but never this, which I can only describe as anxiety radiating through my very core, CONSTANTLY. My stomach always hurts and is in knots, I have no appetite, my neck always feels tight, sometimes to the point of my throat feeling constricting, I struggle to get any sleep and still feel wired after only a few hours. Sometimes I have irrational thoughts, like the other night when my foot fell asleep and I honestly believed it would never return to normal. 

The main cause for me is definitely the fact that I’m soon going to be leaving my job to go to grad school and begin a new career path. I can handle the occupation, but not the imaginary bullshit about the future that my mind won’t stop stressing over.

So a little backround, I'm 23 years old. 2 small children. I was a stay at home mom for a portion of the year until recently when I got a job as an expo in a kitchen..about a month ago. I was off Sunday so I decided to go out with my sister for the first time in forever, and have a few drinks. Without delving too much into it, I'm an extremely self-critical person. When alcohol gets involved I am 10x worse. I've had anxiety since I was about 12-13 years old, getting worse and worse over the years. I've had some bad panic attacks before, but today was the absolute worst one I ever experienced. So last night, conversations ran pretty deep and I carried everything into the next day. From subjects of my past and a narcissistist ex, let's just say my mental state of in a bad state of mind. I had work at 4 and was ok until about 20 minutes before I left for work. Me being new, I have some natural anxiety on top of what I was feeling today. 
About 3:30: stood up from the couch to get my shoes on. Hands buzzing, legs wobbly, dizzy. Starting to feel the attack coming on. Rushing out the door. 
3:45: Close to work. Panicking. Making fiance stop car several times because I could not breath. Throat felt closed. Heart racing. Thought I was having a heart attack. Mind knew it was panic, body did not agree. 
3:55: Pulling into work driveway. Made fiance park car. For the first time in my life my stomach felt physically sick from panic attack. Reached for closest thing to puke. Repeating ""I can't do this. I can't go in"" over and over for fiance. 
4:00: Call my best friend. Try to see if she can calm me down. In tears at this point. Heart racing. Sick to stomach and uncomfortable. Starting to feel disassociated. 
4:05: Hubby tells me either call off, go inside and explain, or clock in. Feel Frozen in fear. Afraid managers will think I'm faking it to party for new year's. (Did not drink at ALL tonight. Pledged that I'm never drinking again after today)
4:10: Go in. Host says I look really pale. I'm shaking. Heart still racing. Fighting off urge to faint. I'm now anxious about talking to managers even though they're all nice and understanding. 
I go to the kitchen and the manager sees me and immediatly asks if I'm okay. I explain and get told I have to get a doctor's note or else I'll get points. She's nice about it. My fiance came back and picked me up from work. He was very supportive, but I for some reason couldn't stand the driving motion as it was making me sick and panic. I have never felt like this before. When at home I called my sister and she somehow calmed me completely down from the panic attack. We relieve the babysitter and I go upstairs and lay  in bed and fall asleep for a hours. I still feel panic residue but much better. I have work tomorrow and very much do not want to go. If anyone has had a panic attack of this magnitude, I give you all of my kudos.

On the 12th of december i got really sick. I was freezing from head to toe even though i was under all of my blankets. That night i had my first major panic attack in 10 years. It came right as i was about to fall asleep. I suddenly had this feeling of dread like something bad was about to happen. Seconds later I got hit with this wave of what i can only describe as feeling like i was about to die. I started shaking all over and fearing for my life. Not really knowing what to do I took one of my blood pressure pills and chugged a bottle of water and curled up in a fetal position in the shower hoping the hot water would help. About an hour later it had finally subsided and i collapsed on my bed and passed out.

The following day i woke up and my left arm and both of my feet half way up my shins were partially numb. I told my parents and not wanting to be alone i laid down in the living room while my mom was cleaning the house. That afternoon I decided to go to urgent care. The doctor (in short) did an ekg to make sure it wasn't my heart, then had told me i was panicking and he wrote me a prescription for lorazepam. I took 1 a day for the next few days and i was feeling fine.

A week later i have another one right as i was about to pass out again. This time I was thinking i may have had an allergic reaction to some food i ate(grabbing at straws). So i started micromanaging everything i was eating. Making sure not to eat anything that i had eaten the previous times it had happend. I was fine for about another week.

Last Friday. I had one in the middle of work. I hadent eaten anything yet that morning. I grabbed my bottle of water and just walked out of the building and down the road avoiding talking to anyone. I had a few more minor ones before the end of the day and I would go to the bathroom or try to isolate myself some how while they happened. I got home and collapsed in bed.

Saturday was pure hell from the second i woke up. I had 2 major episodes through the day. Then the most intense one I have had happened at ~10 pm. I walked into my parents room shaking and crying saying I need to go to the ER. The entire time I just remember appologizing to them.(r/aww saved my life that night) I had 3 more before before i finally got a room, and then 4 more while I was in the room. The doctor ran a blood panel and did some tests to make sure I wasnt having a heart attack or a stroke. Everything came back negative. he said that lack of sleep could be having this effect on me(all of this in more detail but it was 3am and i havent slept in 19 hours.) I've always had problems sleeping and didnt really think about it. He prescribed me some ambien and a nurse gave me a dose before i left and we went home and i passed out.(not taking the benzo and Ambien at the same time) the Ambien helped with falling asleep but my usual method of visualization to calm down was useless. My mind was just a vomit of everything in my head.

Sunday was the day i felt most insecure about myself. I woke up crying. My mom and my visiting aunt took me out just so i didnt feel alone. We went out for lunch, did some shopping, and went bowling. It was a good morning. I had only had some minor episodes while we were out. I had some major attacks after we had gotten home. My girlfriend came over to be with me(i honestly dont know where i would be without her). Just laying in bed watching youtube videos helping me whenever i had my attacks. I decided I wanted to sleep around 7 so i took one of the Ambien. And she was going to stay with me until i fell asleep. About an hour later I was still awake and then another major attack happens. And it hit me extra hard because i thought the Ambien would sedate me enough to not have one. I spent the next half an hour sitting on the toilet just as a seat trying to grasp what was happening and crying deeply out of insecurity. My loving family and GF were all there supporting me and giving me advice. All the mean while my brain was white noise and couldn't concentrate on a single thing. I decided to take a hot shower and then go to bed. My parents were checking on me all night to make sure how i was doing. I felt like I was tossing and turning all night but my mom said I was sound asleep.

Today i also woke up crying but the attacks have become a lot more mild or sometimes just the build up but never really a full attack. I think the Ambien is helping me get the rest i need.

Future, trying to get a doctor to check me out on NYE has gotten me no success. I go back to work on Wednesday. I'll fight my way through. Im not letting this nightmare of a vacation take me out. 

Tomorrow is a new day, a new year. I want to put this behind me and get my life back.

P.s. Ambien dreams are weird...

The anti depressants have not started working yet and my dad is getting worse. He has been signed off of work but has convinced himself that because he saw two different doctors this is somehow fraud (?) And that he's going to get fired and go to prison. He also thinks he's implicated my brother somehow and he will be arrested too. He is refusing to see the doctor again and can't be reasoned with.

t2_8zw8y1i,"Over a year ago I started driving for Uber because we very seriously needed any extra money. I had to stop almost immediately because my anxiety wouldn’t allow me to in good conscious drive others around. I felt devastated. I felt like a failure. I felt like shit, I couldn’t help my family when the time needed it. 

I recently picked up where I left off because his work gave a hefty heads up that they were taking off for the holidays for way too much time and it was unpaid. I’ve been doing decent with it. I’ve helped make enough to help us stay afloat and was able to help make sure Christmas was still magical for our kids.

I knew tonight (or last night) would be a big deal, good money. All the time leading up to New Years I’ve been debating if I wanted to put myself through it with my anxiety. I’ve been doing OK but what if it was too much on me? 

I fucking nailed it. I made more in one night/morning than I’d made the whole week combined. I was sociable! I freaking went places I’ve never driven before. I don’t know. I feel so on top of the world. I remember feeling my throat tightening in between one ride and thinking “it’s just roads sunny. Just roads” and was able to calm myself down. I’ve NEVER been able to calm myself down. In fact by the end of the night I was eager for new rides and I was calm. 

Flipping calm, a word I never ever thought I’d used to describe myself ever.  I don’t know how long this high will last but.. I’m glad I can share it with you all. Happy New Years!

I wanted to shed some light on the ASMR lovers out there.   
ASMR for those who don't know is a treatment (tingling + relaxing) sensation that is triggered by calming noises ect.  
everybody has a different trigger that makes them relaxed and calm.  


Hopefully this is not counted as self promoting, but for those who are looking for a source, I will be making a new video everyday of new foods, to help those who enjoy ASMR.   


Regardless, I will be making videos on it everyday as I do it mainly for my cousin who suffers from strong anxiety, and this seems to relax her nerves. So hopefully I can touch others by at the same time. :)

Im 20 years old and I'm in college. It's been almost a year since I've had a job and I lost all of my friends from narcissistic abuse. Aside from that, I'm in college for a music education, so I can lead worship in church. But i also at one point want to get my doctoral for psychology, and become a clinical psychologist. 

This year terrifying in the context of change. I'm not that bad when it comes to change, and im pretty adaptive with it too. But I'm terrified because getting a job, getting a liscence and eventually taking care of myself is a really hard thing to realize. I can't sleep normally some nights, and I find myself being slumped in bed all day not getting anything done, and feeling even more worthless because I didn't do anything. So I'm in a perpetual cycle of just self loathing and self hatred and laziness. I cant tell if this is depression, or actual laziness. 

Job interviews scare the hell out of me, and I hate phone calls. I used to be better with in in my last job, but long story short i worked with my abusive ex at the time. And she was the one that helped me get the job in the first place. Ive always thought I wouldn't have gotten the job if it wasnt for her. 

I have about a month before I need to get a job, and actually become an independent adult. Im excited for that aspect of it, but everything that comes with constant pressure to perform for superiors and dealing with disagreeable people in the work place, makes me want to cowar in a corner, cry and beg to never leave and to have me shot. 

I don't know if others can relate to this. And I know I'm just trying to make excuses not to work, but working isn't the issue for me... I'm a really hard working person when it comes to giving me a task. Im really quick with it too. But its the process of actually GETTING a job that makes it so fucking horrifying. 

If I don't, I'll most likely have to leave college for a while, and live with my parents up until i actually find a job to work. I feel so useless and worthless, and I just don't know how to get over my anxiety over it all. 

Im sorry for my rant. 

TLDR: im worthless and scared of job interviews, and working in general because people terrify me from judging me, and I cant get over my fear of it.

t2_13jbav,"I might be starting 2019 off with my first anti-depressant. My GP has suggested escitalopram based on my symptoms. Over the past 3-4 months (out of no where) I have experienced a few panic attacks and very high baseline anxiety. I also experienced mid-level depression that has fluctuated to periods of major depression. 

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a short timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period). 

I'm looking for any experiences that high-functioning individuals have had on this anti-depressant. What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state (but experiencing a depressed/anxious disorder).

t2_115r6d5h,"Im a student now in the third year of college. Last autumn 2017 (second year of studying) i was trying to catch up with missing courses from first year, but i got very depressed and couldn't study at all and failed my courses again... I stayed home and got isolated since i had no social context or friends to hang out with, spiraling my anxiety and depression. I was sure everyone hate med. Things like going to the supermarket to buy food was extremely difficult. All the anxiety and failing to study made me feel like shit and worthless. This made my anxiety and depression spiral downwards.

&amp;#x200B;

In januari 2018, i began new courses, this time i went to the lectures and didn't stay home. I joined a procrastation support group, for students which have the same problem. The group meet up once a week and you set goals and evaluate yourself and e.g. get plus or minus if you met the personal goals for the last week, you then set new goals for next week. It might sound terryfying and harsh, but everyone in the group is very friendly and supportive. You set your own goal and noone judges, cause we all struggle with the same thing.  In the group i got new friends to hang out with and realised im not the only one struggling with procrastination and anxiety when studying. This combined with other things in my life like finding new friends, and joining activities made me feel way better this year. The spring was hard, but i got a little better at studying. Eventually this fall i progressed alot in procrastinating less. I made and followed my schedules and structure which have shown results in my studies. The structure makes me being able to relax when coming home, knowing i studied enough today. The result is my stress and anxiety go down alot. Compared to 1 year ago, life feels feels amazing. (Ofcourse this isn't the only reason, alot of other things affected my mental health aswell)

I left for my trip and came back to the lease. $500 more this year than the last!!! I can barely afford that...I couldn’t sleep, spent all night crying and worrying and not knowing what to do. I LOVE this place but it doesn’t feel safe anymore. I look at other apartments but nothing feels right. I sent my poor SO like 40 texts of me panicking.

t2_1r32ln1s,"In the last 6 months, I have really struggled hard with derealization and anxiety; in the last few weeks, more of the latter.It is accompanied by obsessive thinking about fearful, intrusive thoughts, random spurts of heightened tenseness and panic, a general feeling of doom/emptiness, and more of that fun stuff.

Anyway, most of my life, my dad has lived with PTSD, earlier diagnosed as schizophrenia, brought on by a horribly turbulent, abusive and traumatic upbringing in his earlier years. His most predominant struggle with the illness(es) is that he hears voices (auditory/verbal hallucinations) that appear very realistic and are hostile and aggressive, and he is also paranoid/suspicious about random things. I have lived through some of his darker episodes and periods of these illnesses and seen and heard and experienced him doing some crazy, worrying, heartbreaking and infuriating things, and I believe as a result of being subjected to a prolonged and continuous amount of that stuff, it has left me with some mild anxiety issues over the years, however, in the last 6 months, out of nowhere, it has gotten immensely worse, along with my derealization. He has been in a comparatively far more stable state now for the better part of 2 years, but now in recent times, I have this obsessive, frightening, horrible fear that I too will start hearing things that aren't there and basically end up like my dad. It's causing me unbelievable distress and panic, and I'm constantly plagued with this ominous feeling and question the reality of subtle, more quiet noises, in fear that I am imagining them (i.e. little noises, like creaks in the house, high frequencies, etc.).

Can someone please tell me how to stop this ruthless thinking cycle and also explain the chances of (i know this sounds illogical) getting PTSD/schizophrenia if you've had a parent with it?

t2_m3qsp,"I'm curious as to how some of you have effectively treated this. 

I'm wondering if this is simply one single problem or two separate issues. The main problem is severe reoccurring episodes of intense anxiety, severe nausea, intermittent abdominal pain and frequent vomiting. Could be once a year, could be 5 times a year. Symptoms can last a day or several days, leading to restlessness, lack of sleep and dehydration. 

Stress and menses could possibly be a trigger of sorts but otherwise there seems to be no pattern other than a ""feeling"" of an episode coming on followed by a slow build up of symptoms. 

Most oral antiemetics don't work when it becomes a full blown episode and then once the vomiting starts, obviously nothing will stay down. Taking stuff like Zofran, promethazine, Compazine etc may slow down the effect but generally doesn't abort it in severe cases. 

We've basically been to numerous doctors, a GI specialist. Lots of things have been ruled out but there was never a definite diagnosis. Everything is essentially normal medically speaking.

t2_k75tgrj,"A little over a week ago, perhaps 2 weeks ago now my wife got sick in the middle of the night which woke me up. Shortly after I myself started feeling sick so I went downstairs and convinced myself that I was just in my own head. My heart was beating a million beats per second, I was sweating, shaking, and nauseous. After convincing myself I was just being silly I finally calmed down but this took hours and hours of standing in my kitchen trying to calm down. By the time I finally felt comfortable enough to fall asleep it was about 5am and I had to call in to work because I needed to be at work at 8.   


I woke up at about 9 and got very little sleep, I spent that day taking care of my wife trying to make her feel better. I didn't have an appetite the whole day and outside of feeling a bit sleepy I actually felt fine. That night before bed the very same symptoms washed over me and I spent the whole night standing in the kitchen again trying to calm myself down once more. Heart racing, shaking, nauseous, tired. I went to bed around 5am again and again called in sick to work.   


My wife was at this time fully recovered, I hadn't told her what was going on as I didn't want her to worry/think I am weird. When she came down that morning at about 9am to see why I was asleep on the couch I told her I had really bad insomnia and had fallen asleep down there. That night while I felt very nervous about having this happen again I was so tired from lack of sleep that I finally fell asleep at about 9 but I woke up early that morning at about 4am and had to run to the bathroom with horrible diarrhea. After that was done I got worried again and started shaking, I felt like the walls of the house were closing in on me and felt like if I didn't leave the house I was going to be ill. So I went to work very early and told my boss I was just trying to catch up on work that I was behind on from calling in. I lied to my wife and told her that I got an on-call and needed to go in early. (again the thought of her worried about me makes me anxious). I got into my office and much like I would in the kitchen I sat in my office and calmed myself down then felt completely fine.

That night rolled around and I started having those extreme feelings of dread wash over me like I was becoming ill again. I had to tell my wife at this point what was going on, so I told her that I just needed to get out of the house for a minute, so I went to Walgreens panicking the whole way there but as soon as I got there I started to feel completely normal. Once I got there I was hoping to buy zzzquil but ended up getting NyQuil to basically force myself to sleep. I took it and fell asleep woke up the next morning feeling GREAT that I had finally gotten a nights sleep.  


Every single day now for going on over a week, I spend the whole day feeling completely fine. As soon as I get home I feel twinges of anxiety but I tell myself if I just take my mind off it I'll be fine so I read and watch TV. Sometimes I'm okay until about 7pm then the very same horrible feelings wash over me, I leave the house and go stand in my office in the middle of the night until I'm calm, then go home drink some NyQuil and go to sleep. Sometimes I'm fine until even later, I wake up at like 2am and start panicking then have to leave the house to calm down at my office some more before going back.

t2_10zoet,"This is my first time posting anything to reddit. I'm sorry if this is long and confusing but I need help and I don't know what else to do. 
I have been diagnosed with GAD. I mostly function well and live a happy life, but when it hits me, it really hits me. I have a panic attack, I break, I cry for hours and sometimes it takes me days to recover. I've already seen three different therapists and none helped me. The only person who has ever understood me is my (long-distance) girlfriend. I felt such a relief when we first started dating, all my problems got so much better. But they were still there and kept showing up and messing things up.
 I'm also just a weak person in general. It takes very little for me to wind up in tears and need her help. And she always helps me. I help her too when she has problems but it's obvious who's stronger and helps who more. I've gotten worse recently and needed help her help more, but whenever I said I felt like I was being selfish she'd say that it was okay and that if I needed help she'd help me, always and that I'd help her whenever I was strong enough to. I've gotten to a point where I can't see her sad or crying without breaking myself, meaning she has to recover herself and then help me and I know that's not fair. 
Well this night she snapped and I don't blame her for a second. I am currently visiting her and staying at her house. We had a small argument, I got anxious, broke, she broke too, I couldn't help her and then after a while she started complaining. She said that she couldn't take it anymore, that I was being selfish and unfair and was expecting too much of her. She got extremely angry at me, kept telling me that I had to find some way to improve myself and to make it up to her tomorrow morning. She told me she was not breaking up with me but she did kick me off of her room by saying ""go away.""
I don't know what to do. I don't know how to fix my problems, it seems like I've tried everything short of medication and nothing works. My previous therapist said I wasn't bad enough to need meds so I'll believe him. I don't know how to better myself. I don't know how to make it up to her and fix this huge mess I've created. I don't want to lose her. I love her so much. Without her in my life I'm pretty sure I would've killed myself years ago. She says the same is true for her and that she'd never hreak up with me, but who knows if she'll change her mind. I want her to be happy and I want to make myself a better person. I'm at a loss.

I'm 23 years old with my first, full time, benefits job, for less than a year now.  I'm in a competitive field, and i'm in a supervisory role, which is kinda unusual for someone so young. I'm completely overwhelmed by my job. I'm terrified of fucking up. I feel constantly like an imposter. I work for a nonprofit and I feel a lot of obligation to do right by the people I serve and the organization. There's been a couple of days lately where I haven't worked at all.

In my class, today we were cutting and pasting things onto a notebook, and the other 2 girls, who sit across from me in a square table, were chatting away together and not involving me in their conversation, a totally natural thing to do, idk they might know each other from other classes or something. 
But no. My anxiety immediately spiked and I became paranoid of everything. 
I became hyperaware of the way they spoke, of the way the other groups interacted, of the way I looked today, and every single word I said since I walked into the class. It was SO bad. I wanted to throw up.

I have been dealing with depression since 2013 (probably before too). In 2016 when I accepted me as a gay guy things seemed to improve and that same year I got into a relationship. In 2017 I revealed myself to my family. While this relationship lasted I was distracted from the pain, after discovering the various betrayals that destroyed the relationship, it was as if pain had taken center stage in my life again. Now it's been three weeks since I have to look back at my problems and my pain. There is nowhere else to go, what has cheered me for a while in the end was only the springboard to return to the bottom of the pit in the most painful way possible. 

 I have become a broken person, I know that this is just a repertoire for life, an experience common to many other people and that there are people who have bigger problems.  

Anyway the pain does not seem to want to leave, I do not miss the old boyfriend, I do not love him anymore. I miss being happy, I miss loving. I know that I must now build my emotional stability on things that depend only on me, but it is incredible how I am being swallowed up in solitude even though surrounded by an incredible network of support, family, and friends.

 It's time to face the ghosts of the past, to solve my emotional problems, now I'm alone. I will have to sit at the table with my feelings: anguish, pain, lack of self-esteem, anger, frustration, contempt, pessimism, shame, hopelessness, disappointment, discouragement, embarrassment, exhaustion, mourning, guilt, insecurity, loneliness, sadness and boredom

 However I do not feel pessimistic despite all these feelings, I think at the moment are a natural response to the trauma, I am human. Just as my life has been changing radically since 2013 I know that this state of change will continue.

While my parents know about the last two, they don't even think that I have anxiety and even if they do, they'll think it's my fault.

So, I've had anxiety ever since high school. It's the kind of anxiety that wanes every now and then, but comes back too. I have panic attacks, but I've almost always kept them hidden so nobody else except ""close friends"" know. I'm scared over the smallest things, like my friends seenzoning me thinking I just fucked up, or my cat being left at home thinking he'll be stolen or something. I feel better when I'm talking to someone about the topic, and while my friends are very helpful, I feel that it would be better if I could talk to my parents about this.

I've told them countless times that I feel this way, but boy, I don't know. Instead of helping me they get pissed. When I try to explain further, they'll pull out the ""I feed and support you so I'm always right"" card. Forcing me to interact among unknown people when I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT, always telling me what to do, taking away my use of tech cause they think it's interfering with my studies and making me an asshole (what?), and so much more. They think I'm entitled and even compare me to the poor kids, but it's a logically flawed comparison. Of course I can't correct them. They think they're so smart they're r/iamverysmart material. I don't know why they're like this, but maybe because I'm actually sociable and nice with my dudes and gals and even a bit naughty, in a non-sexual way of course ;)

Whenever they get angry, they do the typical parent scolding, but this makes me panic a lot of the time. They think me panicking is because I'm an asshole to them, but in fact, it's because I HAVE ANXIETY DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND! 

One time (no, four times actually) I raised my voice, then my dad beat me. I had nothing to do but to block his blows (which he and my mom interpreted as me fighting back). I was suffering a panic attack at that time, and I could not do anything. I just let it happen. Afterwards, deleted all my games (even Discord, which they thought is a game). Big oof to me.

I love my parents, and I know they love me. You may think this is Stockholm Syndrome but no, it's genuine. It's just they're too much.

And then that's about it. You can ask me questions about things, I'll happily answer them. Clarifications too. And help, I'd appreciate that very much.

I'm proud of myself because I'm taking steps to improve my anxiety but on the other hand I am absolutely petrified of mental health professionals. When I was 13 or 14, I attended an anxiety group therapy (they refused to call it that though, it was called 'Keep Calm' *shudder*)- I hated it because I felt so invalid in my struggle as people seemed to be so much worse than me. So I pretended to be OK and they closed my file.Over the years, I still feel those feelings of invalidity, fear of being misunderstood, insecurity in regards to being vulnerable, feeling confused about what's actually wrong with me etc.

I have my first consultation with a triage nurse over the phone which. I don't know what to tell them... Whenever I speak about anxiety, I always tone it down so people don't get worried about me. So I'm scared I'm going to revert back to that coping mechanism and they'll just turn me away because I'm not 'ill enough' to need treatment.

t2_2mkwfp65,"Hello!

Today my SO and I are going to see their heart doctor and I’m going to attempt talking to them about prescribing anti-anxiety medications. My SO is not diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but... his symptoms are honestly making life very difficult. It feel mean to say that but it’s the honest truth. He keeps having panic attacks so bad he thinks he’s having a heart attack which just makes it worse. It’s often difficult for me to leave the house because he’s so anxious about something happening to me. I need to send several updates and even then he isn’t fully calm until I’ve been home a while. He has so many triggers that he can’t even enjoy what used to be hobbies because small aspects of them (for instance he can’t read what used to be favorite books because of how many pages he has to skip to avoid triggers) send him into panic attacks. 

The problem is that he will 100% refuse therapy. I don’t want to share his personal history but a childhood therapist severely violated his trust. I’m pretty sure if his doctor insists on therapy my SO will start panicking right there. 

So my questions are;

1. Is is going to be weird if I bring this up? My SO suffers from selective mutism and likely won’t be able to talk about it. 

2. How can we refuse therapy without seeming like drug seekers. We’re not necessarily asking for Xanax. He’d actually prefer something to take everyday that prevented the attacks than something that stopped attacks from happening. 

3. Advice on how to talk to the doctor about what is happening without sounding like “boo hoo my life is hard even though they’re the one with the illness.”

I was on medication for two or three years, but decided to drop it, as I felt like it really held me back. A few years later again and I went to university, and held this confident facade quite well. 

Recently, I've started a new class at university, and the majority grade is for a debate. Now, if it was the case where the debate was only a small percentage of the grade, then I'd drop it, and lose the mark completely, but because of the high weighting, then I don't really have an option. I feel so locked down that I can't express myself, and for a debate, I know I won't participate. I've always found it really difficult to express myself, I struggle to talk to family, and friends. I won't answer the door, or the phone to people I don't know. I refuse to speak up in class and express my thoughts. I have difficulty remembering words, and lose my train of thought, and then sometimes people laugh, or make remarks, even close family have done it, so it has just further locks me down. I really don't know who to turn to, and I just wanted this off my chest. Sadly, Reddit was really the only place where I felt I can talk about it.

I've emailed the tutor, she said not to worry. I've emailed the disability department, and I'm awaiting a reply. I'm at the stage where I'd drop out of university completely, or wait a year and transfer. I consider myself one of the best of the year up to this point, really pushing myself to succeed, but this debate has been a huge hit to my confidence.

It has brought horrible feelings of depression. I'm struggling to drive without horrible thoughts. I honestly can't believe a debate has triggered this, I was feeling fine a month ago.

t2_286luxcq,"I [31F] have terrible anxiety surrounding work. 

Right now, I'm on day 3 at a new job (grooming dogs) and the anxiety has returned worse than before. I'm sitting here feeling the tightness in my chest and muscles starting. I quit my last (and best ever) grooming job back in September during a panic episode. 

I take only Xanax, because everything else screws with my body too badly (painful rashes on my face, vomiting, non stop periods, etc). I have a diagnosis of bipolar II as well, which I don't necessarily agree with... But it's in my medical records. 

Anyway, I know a big contributor to this is the involuntary psych watch I was placed on as an 18 year old. I have a huge problem being anywhere that I can't just leave. Jury duty has been another bad trigger in the past, with full on panic attacks in the court room during selection. Twice. 

So, like I said, I groom dogs. I have done this for over 10 years, and I'm very good at the actual grooming part... But I can't deal with the constant  need to meet 2-3 hr turnarounds on live animals. I want to leave the second I walk in the door. I have applied hundreds of times for other jobs in other industries (which I never get hired for and rarely even get an interview for), but even the thought of those causes this same feeling at this point. I have lost or quit every job I've ever held because of panic attacks at work. 

I tried to talk to my GP about this on Tuesday, but she just didn't get it. She rudely brushed it off as I just have to do what I have to do. Even going to see her sparks a panic attack at this point and I was fighting back tears in her office. 

The last time I tried talk therapy, THAT started a panic attack, and an angry one at that... Because I felt like the therapist wasn't willing to actually HEAR me. 

My husband is disabled with a benign brain tumor, so I literally have to get over this and work... Or bills cannot be paid. But even he does not get it. He does not understand how crippling this is. The last few months as a stay at home mom were heaven for me. Hardly any anxiety... Now that I've been forced to return to work or starve, I can barely function in any part of my life because I'm consumed by the anxiety surrounding working. To add to it, this kills my sex drive and then he pressures me for sex, saying he doesn't mean to, but he has needs. I can't meet those needs in this mental state. So now, he is visibly upset and plods around the house putting off angry energy that I pick up on so keenly. And he just doesn't understand why this makes everything a million times worse for me. He has zero ability to empathize. So I have no support. No one understands this.

I'm extremely logical, and sometimes my family treats me like that makes me robotic. Like I don't understand emotions or anxiety. Recently, I realized that my logic is a result of my being *extremely* emotional and anxious. I used to worry about and dwell on absolutely everything. So, I came up with a system that helped me. 

First, I'd ask myself ""Is there a specific reason why I'm upset right now?"" This would make me focus, and helped me get rid of the existential anxiety of "" 0\_0 LIFE."" That existential anxiety is paralyzing, and you can't do anything about it. Life is a progressive series of moments with varying level of chaos, and that will never change. The only thing that bothered me more than my anxiety was the idea of not living my life.

Then, I'd ask myself ""If there's a specific reason why I'm upset, is there anything I can do about it?"" If there wasn't anything I could do or the was just inevitable, I put it aside. Life is full of inevitabilities, and I can't stop the sun from rising, no matter how much I want to.

And to be honest I made huge progress! I went from feeling like I was literally going to die at any moment for a whole month last February to not having a single panic attack since August. 

....until today. I've been working on a project that seems to have been doomed from the onset, it's been the pinnacle of Murphy's law. And every time something goes wrong, regardless of whose actually at fault, it's me that has to deal with the blame and fall out. And there's been a lot of angry fall out. To the point where when the project name pops up in my email, people asking for updates, I immediately get tense and nauseous.

Anyway, came in this morning and my coworker had emailed me to let me know that she had royally fucked something up and an entire portion of the project will need to be redone. And then she reached out to our client letting them know that it had been restarted without checking in with me or the lead. Queue me getting sweaty, shakey, nauseous, and on a one way trip of catastrophesizing this straight into a panic attack.

Basically I am supposed to hop on a 8 hour flight in the next few days for a large presentation. Travel and public speaking are two of the things that make me most nervous in life so I knew this was going to be a problem but now I can't avoid it anymore

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I traveled I had what I think was an anxiety attack the day before the flight. I couldn't decide what to pack and ended up sobbing and hyperventilating on the ground. Then I walked around like a zombie for 2 hours. My brain was so clouded I literally couldn't think. Eventually I got up the courage to ask my SO to help me pack and he did. I got on the plane the next day with no issue and was totally fine for the whole trip (but this did not include any sort of presentation)

So I guess I'm afraid that is going to happen again, especially because I have a lot of work I need to be doing at the same time and a presentation.

t2_eyw0p,"TL;DR at the bottom 

So I am a 20 something year old student, and for almost my entire life I've had pretty major anxiety (to me at least) when it comes to relationships with girls. I've never had an issue when it comes to talking to girls when dating isnt on the table, but as soon as I get it into my mind that I'm interested in a girl I tend to freak out. Pathetic, I know. I'm a smart dude (obviously not smart enough to finish college in 4 years) and I'm honestly pretty good at reading signals, too. I've just never been too good at reacting to them properly. Too often I will justify reasons in my head why a girl is not interested in me, in order to both save me from the embarrassment of rejection and pain of severed emotional attachment.

To put things into perspective, a year or so ago I was talking to a girl that I liked and I had asked her out for drinks. She said that she would but she wasnt currently looking for a relationship. I probably should have saved that text and made it my background, but instead I thought, ""ok, shes not interested in me right now. That's fine, I can get to know her, she can get to know me, and we can reevaluate down the road."" We went out multiple times, the conversation was good and we often stayed past closing time just talking. I thought there might be a connection. We kept talking over phones and occasionally I would get flirty photos and videos from her in her underwear. So at this point I thought maybe her perception of me changed, but at the same time, something felt off. Initially I chalked it up to anxiety, but didnt want to force myself onto a girl who didnt want me. I got busy for a few weeks and we stopped talking for a bit, and out of the blue she sends me a text that says ""what would you think if a girl you liked who you havent talked to in a while sent a message that said 'I miss you'."" At this point I thought for sure she was talking about me, so I told her I'd be pretty damn excited. But instead of saying 'I miss you', she replies with ""i dont know, it's kind of complicated."" So I left it at that. A few weeks later she hits me up and says she wants to catch up and get coffee, so I go and it ends up turning into bowling, drinks, and ice cream, all in that one night. The entire time, I'm sold that she is into me, but I'm so anxious and dont know what to do that I begin questioning every reason I think shes into me. At this point we're in her car with ice cream, so I confront her about how I'm feeling unsure about the signals shes sending and she physically cringes and says to me ""maybe if things were different."" Come to find out, the guy she wanted to text ""I miss you"" too was a buddy of mine that I had figured she was interested in before we started talking. The entire time I had talked to her, beyond the snaps, the videos, her inviting me over to her house and answering the door in jeans and a bra and then being cold and distant the entire evening as we watched a movie, there was always something in the back of my mind that made me freak out and assume she wasnt interested, and everytime I chalked it up to my anxiety.

You could call me an idiot for thinking something might happen between us, or even a pussy for not ignoring my anxiety and going for it in the moments. Either answer could be right, and honestly I dont even know anymore, the whole experience has fucked with my head.

The reason I tell that whole story is because I'm currently talking to a girl who I find to be funny, cute, and smart, and she and I have a ton in common. We have the same class and often study together. First it was as a group, but then she and I started meeting separately. She seems interested in me and we've made plans to do some of the things we both like together, and my best friend is convinced shes into me. But I still have this nervous anxiety that points out to me all the reasons she might not be interested. For starters, when we text, she doesnt always reply to my messages and there is usually a decent amount of time between messages, but when we are studying she is pretty quick to respond to her messages within minutes. There are other clues that make me think she isnt interested but that's a big one for me.

I think I like this girl, and I dont want to give up on another possible relationship because of what I think the other person is feeling. But most importantly I'm just tired of feeling paranoid and anxious when it comes to this shit. I'm really sorry for the huge message and maybe this isnt the place to post this, but I need help. My relational anxiety is tearing my life apart and keeps me from building any kind of serious relationship and I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like when I talk to my friends, they only tell me to stop thinking about it so much, which just makes me think about it more.

If anyone has advice on what to do about this situation, techniques on how to handle my anxiety when I start feeling the way I do when I convince myself that no one is interested in me, or even if you just want to send me dog pictures I would greatly appreciate it. I'm having a hard time coping with it all right now.



TL;DR I'm struggling with relational anxiety and am preemptively putting up walls when I'm dealing with my romantic relationships in order to not get hurt but it's not working and I'm still hurting and I don't know what to do.

I work in a joint cubicle with 3 others, in an office of about 20, and since I started 8 months ago, I have not mixed in well with them. Although they know I’m a good worker, I am causing a negative disturbance to the work day.

My brain turns off in most social group situations. One on one is less difficult, but when talking in a group, I lose focus of the conversation, with my mind obsessing about my social performance. That leaves me with nothing insightful to say. Many times very stupid things to say. 

But mostly I say nothing or end the conversation abruptly, avoiding saying the first dumb thing to pop in my head. I’m coming off as standoffish and causing somewhat awkward moments. I try and smile a lot to avoid looking like an asshole but it’s just fucking weird. 

Most people avoid looking at me at all. Some are nice and try and talk to me when I’m alone, but knowing their perception of me just adds to the anxiety.

The Incident: (sorry for the long description) 

I used to work in a furniture store. Anyone who has worked in customer service understands that this industry sucks. I was extremely lucky, however, because I found a store that I actually enjoyed working in. This was mostly because of my amazing co-workers and managers. The majority of the customers were kind, and I don't know, I just enjoyed working there... until I encountered this one customer who I will refer to as Mary from now on.

Like a lot of our customers, Mary is a middle-aged white woman. She was waiting in line and was the only person waiting. My co-worker was helping someone at her till, and I was taking a quick ten-second break because I was feeling ill that day. I quickly noticed that Mary was getting agitated and giving me dirty looks, so I figured she was in a hurry. I opened my till and called her over to help. Here is how the interaction went:

Me: Hi, I can help you over here.

Mary: *walks over to the till* You don’t look like you want to help me.

Me: *slightly taken aback and confused* Oh, I’m not feeling well. I’m sick.

Mary: *getting aggressive* You don’t look like you want to help me. You don’t look like you want to be here. You’re daydreaming. I hope they send you home!

Me: *shocked and speechless* ... *continues scanning her stuff*

I honestly didn’t know what to say to that. I was sooo overwhelmed because she accused me of a bunch of things and was so aggressive. 

Mary: *even more aggressive* You don’t look like you want to help me. You don’t look like you want to be here. You’re daydreaming. I hope they send you home!

Me: *still shocked* ... *scanning her stuff in silence.*

Mary: *even MORE aggressive AND now pointing her finger in my face* You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home!

Me: *managing to scramble enough words* Well, actually, they won’t send me home. My co-worker is going home soon, and I’m the only one here to close.

Of course, that made her even angrier.

Mary: *even MORE aggressive AND repeatedly pointing her finger in my face* You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home! You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home.

Me: *quietly scanning her stuff* ... The only time I uttered another word to her was when I told her the total. She kept screaming at me throughout the entire interaction.

Mary: *Starts leaving, but then turns around and points at me* I hope they send you home!

I honestly didn't know how to react to that. I was genuinely in shock and a bit shaken by the entire interaction. By the end of my shift, I've managed to forget about her. After two weeks, however, I randomly started having vivid flashbacks of the incident. Repeatedly reliving the incident caused my anxiety at work to skyrocket. I was terrified of returning to work. I started having flashbacks every single day. I became depressed. Eventually, I started drinking and smoking to suppress the flashbacks. To this day, I am still experiencing these flashbacks and panic attacks.

Initially, I didn't report this or talked to anyone about it, because I thought I was overreacting. I was also embarrassed because I couldn't defend myself. I just froze up as she hurled abuse at me and I took it like an idiot. What made it worse was that there were people there who witnessed how distressed I was and didn't even bother to tell her to chill or something. I truly regret not kicking her out or calling for a manager, but because I wasn't in the right mental state to deal with that stress, I struggled to process everything that was happening at the moment.

I quit my job in May if that year (2018), and haven’t worked ever since. I’m not in school either. I just stay at home wasting my life away. In July, I visited my family doctor, and she prescribed some medications to help. It has done nothing for me. I still experience these flashbacks and panic attacks. Therapy didn't help either. I don't know what to do. A part of me is terrified of working in a customer service environment again, but that's all I have experience in.

I'm an introvert and never invite people, even close friends, because I feel easily ""invaded"" and uncomfortable. It's like my house is my lair, my nest, the place I recharge and can be alone and relaxed. It feels like it's an extension of my mind, and if people get inside, they will ""get inside me"" (yes, I know, quite illogical but...). I live with my 10-year partner, but he's the exception to the rule. Sometimes a friend of his will stay the night in our spare room, but we usually go out for dinner and they are just here to sleep so I'm not too disturbed. 

My family stayed for 3,5 hours and I was tired and a bit relieved when they left : I had a good time with them, and it was good to see I could stand to have people over for a few hours, but after 2,5/3 hours I felt saturated. The following day I felt drained and blah, but after that I've been feeling my anxiety rise up. 

I'm on Zoloft and assorted medication for GAD, and have been doing better for the last few weeks, but it feels like a setback now. Like I feel I've been invaded by having people at my house, and have trouble getting back in a secure mood. I sometimes have panicky moments thinking ""OMG now my family will think they have a free pass, and not respect my boundaries, or want to contact me all the time etc"". Even though I know it's improbable, they don't usually act like that. 

But it's playing with my fundamental fear of being invaded and not ""at home"" in myself anymore. I've always felt like I'm too empathetic, and too ""porous"" to other people's emotions, and easily disturbed by these.

t2_4mbw6du,"Hi everyone!

Unfortunately my anxiety is expressed in physical symptoms. I find difficulty in taking deep breaths. I really feel super tight in my lower back and it keeps me from taking deep satisfying breaths. I’m pretty sure that this is because of the tension I carry in my back. 

Anyway, I’m super aware of my breathing and I can’t breathe right. People recommended diaphragmatic breathing but breathing in my chest feels better and satisfies more my air hunger. 

I’m always hungry for air. The problem is that it’s a daily thing and stays with me all day. I’ve been to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist. Had an ECG, EKG and Xray done on me and nothing turned up. Been told it’s anxiety, which I’ve had for 6 years now, I’m 24.

I have great things going on in my life, I’m setting and achieving goals, looking after myself health wise and have mostly great relationships around me. 

The people in my life that don’t like me or have made my work life bad in the past, I have chosen to completely ignore and it feels wonderful. It’s a great feeling when you stop caring about other people’s opinions. I know that I’m kind, funny and hard working. Nothing they say will change that. 

I’ve been through bad times and have many stressful situations often in my life but never had depression or self hate that I see in so many other posts on here. It’s hard to relate and seek advice when it’s not relatable to my own situation. I just wonder if anyone else is the same ? 

I am a very organised person. Like everything is meticulous. I always write lists and complete them, I have personal synced diary’s for my friends and my boyfriend so we can plan our summer (they absolutely love it) and all my belongings are pristine (minimalist, konMarie). I get things done months before I need to. 

But yet, I still feel in utter panic mode nearly daily. Because I feel like I have so much to do. It doesn’t matter how organised I am physically, my brain can’t keep up. It makes my stomach do flips and I worry about it until I feel sick. It affects my sleep. The things that have to be completed tomorrow whirl around in my head. I occasionally smoke weed to try and chill me out, sometimes it works, sometimes it makes it worse. 

This week was bad. I came back from a quick vacation  and had really bad jet lag. Only half a day to recover before being back at work. I’ve had a couple days to catch up with new projects (which usually would
take me 2 weeks to complete). Not one decent night sleep in 3 weeks, many many life admin things to do. (Car maintenance, meal prep, training for my first 10k charity run next week) jobs to apply for. Minor court crap to deal with, personal projects that I want to complete (new blog and business plan) Anyone would feel stress in my situation. But I had to take the day off work today. Because I woke up and felt sick with stress and tiredness, the room is spinning. I don’t want to talk to anyone. Knots in my stomach. I’ve got a busy weekend with friends, but the thought of seeing anyone fills me with dread. I can’t cancel as it’s an important one and I’m usually fine with I’m actually with them (no one knows how much I suffer from it) because I actually relax and have a laugh. It’s before and after that I overthink, worry and resent that I have to be social. 

The doctors tried to prescribe me anti-depressants a few years ago but I refuse to take them because I’m a happy person genuinely. I don’t feel like that’s what I need. I haven’t bothered going back since. 

Even when there isn’t much stress in my life, for example on the way back from my vacation. I had such an amazing time and it was so much to take in, it gave me really bad anxiety because I felt completely overwhelmed with life and didn’t know how to process such wonderful memories. Yes.

t2_3bnjbir5,"Well hey everyone. I'm posting this with a throwaway account because I feel terribly ashamed and helpless, and I need some advice. 

A few things about myself... I'm in my 20s now and I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Even as a child, I used be super anxious. I'd always have some sort of tight knot in my stomach. I tried talking to my mom about this once, she told me I was too sensitive. I remember a time where it got so bad that I'd wake up with that feeling, and all I could do was cry. Things like taking a shower or buying groceries were an accomplishment. It took half a year until I felt better again. Generally I'd say that it's fluctuating. Some days I'm not very anxious at all, then the next day I have a flare up and spend my night crying. There is no fixed pattern. Although I can say that things get even worse during the winter months. 

I have troubles dealing with my emotions in general. I do feel, I actually feel a lot. I may not have many friends, but I care deeply about them. I am here for them to listen, I give advice, I care and help as much as I can. However it seems that I can't do the same for myself. I can help others but never myself. 

Other than that, I tend to bottle up everything I feel. I worry too much, I immediately imagine the worst possible outcome. If I fall in love, I think of all the reasons why it's not going to work out. Someone is not texting back, or texting me in a slightly different way than usual? They must hate me. Should I text first? What if that annoys them, what if they don't want to talk to me? Do they even care about what I have to say? These are my unsleeping ever-pacing thoughts, they keep on racing in my mind, and I can't seem to break out of this mindset once I started. I think I am incredibly scared of being left alone, of being abandoned. 

Now, about my current situation. I completed my degree recently. Ever since then I've been feeling down. The burning passion that I had since I started is gone. I always put 100% percent in my work. For my thesis I couldn't. I sat at my desk for hours but never wrote anything down because I knew it wouldn't be perfect. I wrote countless to-do lists and never went through with any of them. I couldn't, I simply didn't have the energy. I was (and still am to a certain extent) constantly tired, I feel burnt out. Sometimes I wake up and feel like I didn't sleep at all. It's almost like there is some sort of veil/fog around my brain that prevents me from thinking and seeing things clearly. And although I passed all my exams in the end, I can't help but feel like an utter failure. 

Eventually I had a session with a psychologist. Apparently I needed to rest, she recommended 3 months. I didn't, my parents made me send applications and now I have a job. It's at a company with a good reputation. They pay very well. They want to send me abroad for a couple of months. Everyone is impressed and congratulates me. I should be happy. But I don't know if that's what I want. I feel uncomfortable, I am hesitating. It's a great opportunity for sure but my dream was it to go back to uni and to become a professor. If I take the offer from my company and go abroad, people will expect me to stay. I might never go back to uni at all. If I do go to uni, I might miss out on a great career and disappoint those around me. Or I fail and never achieve my goal after all. Then I'll wish that I would've accepted the position abroad. 

Here anxiety just completely messes me up. I am scared of making the wrong decision. Or, let's face it: any decision at all. It could be the wrong one, and I might end up regretting it. For a very long time, decisions were made for me. What I wanted was never really important. I avoid making decisions at all costs, it just scares me so much. Unless I am really passionate about a thing, I'd rather choose something that I don't really want to just to please someone else. I depend on the approval of others because I don't approve myself. 
Now I come home from work, I eat, I play video games, then I go sleep. Rinse, repeat. That distracts me from the anguish I feel, I can avoid responsibility. Ultimately I feel that regardless what decision I make, I will always fail. I will never accomplish anything in my life. I will never be good enough.

t2_3bnhlk9k,"TW: Suicide mention

Backstory: I've been dealing with anxiety for 8 years now., and I've kept it to myself. When I turned 20, my cousin passed away and my anxiety/depression was in the most terrible place it had ever been, and I had decided to end my life. My mum happened to intervene (unknowingly) by asking me if I was ok. I broke down then, and told her I feel anxious/scared all the time, but I couldn't really say much more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Its been two years since then, and I still have suicidal thoughts now and then. I've made baby steps with my anxiety, by going to the gym regularly, going to stores and buying shit, I've even gone out to concerts and music festivals. These are huge things for me as before I couldn't even leave my house I was that paralysed by fear. However, its not enough for me. I haven't had a job for years as I get too anxious, I can't take phone calls, I can't go out on a whim, I literally have no friends as my anxiety has caused me to push them all away. I can't get on with my life!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I was always a very independent person, and the past 3 years have turned me into a shell of what I once was. I resent letting myself get this way, I hate who I've become. I know I need help, but I refuse to get it. Sometimes I feel I don't deserve it because I've fucked up my life by letting it get this bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its my goal this year for things to change (even just a little) I'm forcing myself to attend acting classes in June, but I want to seek help from a therapist as well. I don't think I want to be on any medication yet. Has anyone on this subreddit had these sort of issues as well? Did you have any strategies or did you simply force yourself through it?

I'm also a single mother with a seriously crazy ex and his family driving me up the wall. Not exactly a situation that's even remotely stress free...

Either way, I've had a few issues sending my little one to nursery. It's literally across the road, I can see it from my living room window, but there are days when I have to force myself to go out and drop her off. I've been generally fine and the ladies there know I have a few issues and have been very accommodating. 

Today I messed up.

I woke up at 5am and just knew. Yesterday had been fantastic! I went to the shops by myself whilst the wee one was at nursery, bought myself nice things, got the food in, even had tea in a cafe where my friend works so I could get her to serve me and not one of the random members of staff.

And then today.

I just knew today was going to be bad. I wasn't going to be able to go out today, not even across the road. Did I overwhelm myself yesterday or something? I felt fine, nothing bad happened, I felt... normal, happy even.

So I called the nursery and made up some excuse so that I didn't have to take my daughter to the nursery. I knew I shouldn't have done it. They know I have issues, I know that they know, I should have just said, I'm having a bad day, we won't be coming today, and they would have understood and accepted it. I guess they must have thought something was off because they called my mother to make sure I was okay, and then she called me.

Needless to say, it was a stupid thing to do, and I don't even know why I did it. 

Then I almost had a panic attack because I couldn't get my mother to text me back. She said she'd deal with it, but after nearly 20 mins of waiting for a reply, I could feel my body starting to freak out. I couldn't breath right, I was crying, my hands were shaking so I could barely type to ask her to contact me asap.

I know it was my own fault and I just caused a bigger problem for myself, this is the worst day I've had in a while, I don't even know what I was thinking. 

I was on medication for a while, but my memory is crap, so I would always forget to take it, and then it'd be two weeks later when I'd finally remember again. I've been using a few different things to get me doing things. Like having my phone with alarms set for chores and other things. Even if I remember them anyway, I keep using it because it'll be just my luck to forget something sometime, like to start dinner so it's on the table at the wrong time, putting the rest of our schedule out of whack.

t2_1sv3x7s8,"Hello Reddit users, I hope you are doing well today. Reason I created this topic was to hear if any of you have any advice for me.

About two weeks ago I told my doctor I wanted to stop using SRRI's because I felt that I was in a much better place mentally than before I started using them (6 years ago). My struggles recently have been more about motivation and less about the severe depression and social anxiety I was experiencing before. The doctor agreed that it was a good idea, he actually proposed it first some months ago.

So his initial tapering down plan was to start taking 10mg daily instead of 20mg but he couldn't find a way to order a recipe for 10mg capsules in my country, so he said ""Well then you should just stop at once boom"". He said he didn't think I would feel anymore side effects than I was already feeling from having switched from a SNRI and then back to SSRI. I had been feeling vertigo, increased anxiety. I thought I could give his cold turkey plan a try for some time. I had tried tapering down some years ago by taking every 2nd, 3rd day and so on for some months but went back on full dose when I felt the vertigo and increased anxiety after about two weeks. However I was also more sensitive back then and I didn't have the support network I have today.

I have been completely of SSRI for two weeks now. The vertigo has increased but I can work with it. My mood has been varying a lot. I can feel like crying much easier now when I hear a sad song, but I can laugh and have a good time when I am with friends. My sense of reality I feel is slightly changing, it is hard to describe. I would describe it as the background feeling of being alive, like a base anxiety or something like that. I feel more aware but also more anxious. Like I am slowly being sucked into a state of more awareness. I think it makes my tinnitus more noticeable.

I think I will continue not taking any SSRI for at least two more weeks, that is when my doctor will check up on me. I was surprised he didn't propose taking a 20mg capsule every other day when he couldn't find the 10mg capsules. Instead he just gave me the plan to stop immediately. My impression of him has been good, he seems full of knowledge and is helpful and listens.

t2_xncne,"It was a reflective essay, so I decided to talk about stigma surrounding mental health. It was last second, since I procrastinated it (as one does). I wrote about my struggle with my anxiety disorders, how it got so severe that I ended up in a psychiatric ward, and how what I've experienced (and still experience) doesn't make me any less human. I thought it was messy, and I didn't even bother reading over if because it was such a hard thing to talk about. It was only supposed to be a rough draft. 

I genuinely enjoy being in this class. I am always happy to participate, and the professor makes me feel engaged in the class. So it meant a lot when she pulled me aside after class to tell me it was brilliantly written, she has been through what I have, put everything surrounding my point together brilliantly, and someone would never guess that someone who participates and is as bright as I am struggles with such a thing. She thought it was so great that she asked if I ever considered becoming an advocate. She flat out gave me an A on what I figured was simply an unorganized rough draft with some decent points.

Something I threw together without even proofreading, and just figured out as I went along, impressed someone who truly inspires me to want to learn and be better. It made my entire week, and it made me realize the good I can pull out of even the worst situations. I don't think I can adequately put into words how much what she had to say meant to me. 

In August, I put off going to college because of my mental health. Now I'm going and I'm persevering because of my willingness to learn and reflect on what's happened to me. I believe she mentioned how tough something like that is, and I pointed out that I don't think I would be the empathetic person I am today if it wasn't for everything I've been through.

 At this point I am ruminating about stuff and it is driving me crazy. I feel like I am being super over bearing and kind of a freak.

I moved in with my boyfriend about 6 months ago into a shared household. He's been there about a year. Our relationship with the other housemates (2M 1F) has been mixed, but overall amicable. That being said, there are enough issues for us to realise that it's probably best for us to have our own space at this point, and luckily we can afford it. 
Here's when the good old anxiety kicks in for me. Between us, we rent two of the four bedrooms and therefore pay half the rent. We have a 1 month notice policy and sublet from them. Even though I objectively know that it's entirely within our right to give our one month notice whenever we want, I can't help but feel guilt about it. The anxiety in my head is going wild worrying about leaving them with half the rent to pay, the fact that I've only been there for six months and the prospect of potentially have four weeks of really awkward interactions. 
I don't think this is spurred on by nothing though. The last guy who moved out was ripped to shreds for not giving them notice (despite giving them a month) and the housemates themselves don't have a lot of money. They have a tendency to take their frustrations out on us sometimes about ridiculous things which I can go over in more detail if people require.
For more context, I'm a student and we have to move out in August anyway, so I'm anxious to move while prices are low and properties are still available. There are many reasons why it would be good for us to leave now. 

Please give me reassurance that I'm not being an asshole and it will all be okay. Any tips to help break the news in the most amicable way possible would be fantastic too. Thank you everyone.",Moving out and terrified of telling housemates,Anxiety,1,aw6fp7,False
t2_177ozt,"Hey everyone, I recently went through some horrific experiences with anxiety and I'm finally at a place where I can mostly manage it. I wanted to share a little bit of my experience.
In October I had my first panic attack. I was hanging out with my SO and all of a sudden I felt like I was going to die. I'm 20 years old, and while I've had my fair share of social anxiety the feeling of an anxiety attack was foreign to me, so I was terrified. I thought I needed to go to the hospital, but I ended up just pacing around my house until 3 AM, where I was finally exhausted enough to crash. I woke up the next morning okay, but confused about the situation. I thought maybe it was a one time thing, and tried to move on.

About a month later I'm walking around with my SO and experience the symptoms again. Heart racing, feeling like I can't breathe, stuck in a negative thought loop of hell, etc. I ended up asking to play cards with him to calm down, and we did for about 3 hours until I was able to breathe normally. This is when I knew I needed help. I ordered a CBT book online and tried to move on.
I started following the CBT book, which is a 7-week program designed to help you change your behaviors and reactions to negative thoughts. All was well for about a week, until I pushed myself with two cups of coffee instead of one. I was thrown into a terrible panic attack right before I had to leave for school. I was stuck in this phase for about 3 days, couldn't eat, felt sick, thought I was going to die, and honestly, getting severely depressed at this point. I had goals, a future, school to do. How was I supposed to do any of it when I couldn't function? I felt hopeless, so I made an appointment with a therapist and GP.
In the next weeks I experienced some new and terrifying thoughts and feelings. I had major intrusive thoughts about health anxiety, violence (terrified I was going to ""go crazy"" from a panic attack), scared I was going to lose my mind in other ways, etc.

At this point in the story, I'll go over how I started to manage my anxiety. These are tips I learned in order.

1.	Exercise. Everyone knows this, but it is scientifically proven to be one of the best things you can do. You'll force your brain to make the right chemicals for mood improvement.
2.	Sleep. Focusing on this helped me tremendously.
3.	Medication. Now while I'm not a huge fan of daily medication, I still wanted to take something. I opted for an ""as-needed"" medication. I took them for the first 3 days, once a day, and I felt so much better. I stabilized after a couple days and have only needed them about 3 times in the past 5 months. If I ever feel the need to take SSRIs, I will. But it was important for me to try to manage things on my own.
4.	CBT Book or Program. If anyone wants to know which one I used, let me know. This was a good resource for identifying thought patterns, making actionable changes, and recognizing that a lot of people have the same exact irrational thoughts you do. Ultimately, this made me feel less alone and like I was actively helping myself change.
5.	Quit caffeine. Again, this one everyone knows. But I had to quit caffeine for a solid 3 months (after drinking multiple cups of coffee every day for 6 years). I'm just now okay with drinking coffee again, but I make it half-caff just to be safe, I don't want to trigger myself into a panic attack again. 
6.	Therapy. Just going has done a lot for my mental health. When I went to my first session, all I could do was cry. She listed to me and understood everything. I went frequently at first, and when I showed signs of improvement I stopped going as often. But always go at your own pace. 
7.	Tracking My Mood. I started tracking my mood daily, and it really put in to perspective how often I let one bad day ruin the rest of the week. Also, when you have a bad day it helps you remember it’s not always going to be like that. I use the app Daylio for this. 


The Good. 
Believe it or not, I think a few good things came out of this experience, and I would like to share them. 

Perspective shift. This experience really put into perspective how awful poor mental health is. I dealt with a bit of anxiety and depression before, but never that bad. I’m now able to empathize with people a lot more. 

More Stable Mood. I used to just go through these periods of highs and lows. After implementing these strategies, I would say much baseline is neutral/good with a few iffy or bad days here and there. 

Effort in Relationships. I’ve put a lot more effort into my relationships. When I was struggling, I couldn’t bare doing anything alone. I was suffering, and I honestly wanted comfort. I reached out to people more during my hardship and made new friends. 

Health Improvement. Due to the fact exercise and proper sleep is proven to improve mental health, my overall health has improved as well. I used to rarely go out of my way to workout, but I must now, especially if I want to feel “normal”.

I’m bipolar, ADD, and suffer from PTSD. My anxiety can get absolutely out of control sometimes, and over things that make absolutely no sense. Let me give you an example. Right I’m perfectly fine, everything’s okay and there’s nothing to worry about. Then I start to think about what things I could do today, and I say to myself “oh! I’ll get creative and work on that project I’ve been wanting to start” and then out of nowhere just like that, I’m in full on anxiety attack.

So my friend is really not serious about hanging out and I’m starting to question if he really are my friend. 

He has been busy with school so he don’t have much time to hangout. I confronted him saying that he’s lying and that it’s not possible to be busy 24/7 meaning you also need to take breaks.

So we did meetup yesterday and I did not notice anything different in he’s behaviour. 

I asked if he wanted to meetup today. At first he tought I was at work but I told him that I could meet him after. 

He asked where I was. I said home and he said he was in school and doesn’t know when he’s finished? First that is a lie you always know when you’re finish. You can’t sleep at school.

t2_1ops65f6,"This girl is a ray of sunshine. She has one of the most purest souls I’ve ever witnessed. But she suffers from anxiety. Like the always there, constant state of anxiety. Personally, I’ve had my fair share with being anxious but I’m okay at controlling it and I’ve been helping friends with it for over 5 years, so I’m used to it. I’m just looking for suggestions to help her out some. Make her day better. I would go into her backstory but it’s not my place. I’ll just say that she’s had a terrible boyfriend before me (about two years ago) and a realllyyyyy bad experience with what used to be her favorite teacher. She deserves to be happy and filled with joy. She does not deserve the thoughts she has. She does not deserve what she’s going through right now. She really is angelic. 

So I guess my questions are: what do you wish your SO/loved ones did for you when you dealt with constant anxiety? Should I be like “kick anxieties ass today!” or not even bring it up and just try to make her laugh and try to be an escape? Sometimes she tells me to tell her to stop being a little bitch (she calls it tough love) but it just doesn’t feel right for me to do that. 

She says once she graduates HS it’ll be better but I’m worried that it will follow her. She is meeting with a therapist for the first time later today but she isn’t very optimistic about it. She’s worried that it’s wasting her parents money and it won’t change anything.

t2_2vwo7vdy,"Hi everyone! So...I’m trying to write this as coherently as I can, and I hope it all makes sense lol. They’re all undiagnosed, but I know I have generalized/social anxiety and OCD. My mind constantly runs amok, and I fear the worst will happen, to the point of exhaustion, especially about things like social interactions, even just run of the mill stuff. My body is always so tense, my heart rate is always so fast, I’m tired so often, and I’m taking nexium everyday for heartburn. Also, I think my hair is falling out more often than usual, which is an indication of severe anxiety, I think. Overall, I just feel very stuck, like everything seems so hard. 

I’m a college senior set to graduate in a few months, and I just...haven’t been looking for jobs or internships or anything because the prospect of interviews really scares me, like I can foresee me messing up horribly. Over winter break, my parents started nudging me along in regards to potential jobs/internships, like suggesting I apply for this and that, and I would kind of start to avoid them because all that just scares me. They then told me they didn’t understand why I was so resistant to talking about after college stuff, so I kind of broke down and told them that I’m afraid of interviews and working with people! I told them I get so anxious about things, and sometimes I feel very sad about how anxious I get. And they seemed to understand. My mom said “Well, maybe you need to talk to someone”, like therapy. The concept of therapy kinda scares me, but I know it would make me feel better. My dad was really sympathetic and said that it’s okay that I don’t know what to do in regards to after college stuff, and that I’ll figure it out. All in all, at the end of winter break, I felt better because I told them about how I was feeling. I guess I had this idea that after graduation, I could go to therapy and figure things out from there. We didn’t really talk about me having anxiety though after that; I think we just didn’t want to address it? Idk

But then I came home for spring break and my mom starts asking me about jobs and stuff. I was taken off guard and said “oh I thought we said I could talk to someone first...” and she said something like “is it really that bad? I get anxious too. Everyone gets stressed out sometimes.” My mom has always been saying stuff like that when I try to bring up anxiety—that everyone gets nervous, it’ll pass. She attributes my bad anxiety and heartburn to me working on my senior thesis, and that when I’m done with it, I’ll feel better. Sure, thesis writing has exacerbated my anxiety, but it’s by no means the only cause. I just don’t know how to make them understand that I have a disorder. I’m also kind of ashamed that I have bad anxiety, that it ruins relationships for me, and that I’m really lonely sometimes because of it. Overall, it’s really frustrating, and I just feel so stuck. 

My parents are the best parents in the world, and I’m grateful that they want to help me in regards to after school plans. I also realize that their alarm towards me not actively looking for jobs is more that justifiable. I just wish I could make them understand easier.

Ok so this is going to be a long post

I'm a 20 year old Male and I have bad anxiety 
Let's start from the beginning all through my school and college years I have had really bad social anxiety and didnt even realise until it was too late and now I have no one. When I was at college I would be so self conscious when I was doing my work I would never ask for help and would always turn the screen brightness down and angle my laptop so no one could see what I was doing even though I knew no one was watching and when someone was watching i would just completely stop working until they were gone. 
I hate talking about my self and my emotions in fact i hate talking to anyone about anything because i always overthink it and end up saying nothing and not contributing to a conversation. This is often misleading to most people who dont understand me as they just think I'm not interested and have nothing to say when really I have so much to say but by the time I finished going over it in my head it's too late and everyone has moved on. This makes every interaction really awkward especially if it's only me and one other person .
There are a few friends that I feel more comfortable around and will at least engage in a conversation with them however lately most of these people have moved on. So now how am I supposed to meet new people when the few people i feel comfortable around no longer bother with me.
I have only ever discussed my anxiety with one person and only talked about it because he bought it up its like no one else even knows I have anxiety which makes it even more uncomfortable for me.

Lately I've been trying to reach out more but everyone seems to always be busy and I dont want to sound to pushy or desperate so I usually just leave it. I will start typing a message to someone but won't actually send it because I overthink it and even when I am sending a message reaching out to someone I will be going over every word so many times even to the point where one word wont sound right in my head then I will Google the word to make sure it's right even tho I known the whole time  it's right. And it doesn't stop there even after I have sent a message or said something to someone I will be thinking it over in my head. 

After I post this I'm going to be going over it in my head for so long even though I know that it doesn't matter and that no one reading this will care

there are a lot of things i struggle with on a daily basis but here's one that's been especially bothering me: i often feel like i'm not ""cut out"" for the world, if that makes sense. something that's mundane for others can send me into a panic. my anxious mind creates scenarios so awful i need to lock myself in my home and not leave. sometimes i just feel like since these aren't things the average person experiences, i don't really have a right to be here or, i'm not gonna make it.

i can usually cope with general symptoms pretty well but this gnaws at me sometimes. i feel like i don't have a future, at all.

t2_7u1v5,"I had an anxiety attack tonight for the first time in over a year...which in itself is an accomplishment! However, the attack made me realized how stressful some pretty significant things in my life are right now. 

To start, I’m a teacher in one of the worst possible states to be a teacher, Arizona. I hate my administration but a job is a job and I’m working without one of the certifications I really should have through a loophole in the system. I don’t have the certification because I have terrible test anxiety (shocker) and keep failing it. I have plans to keep trying until it is passed but it costs $95 each try.

Next, my hobby is expensive. I own a horse. While I do so in the cheapest way possible, it is a terrible hobby to have with such a low paying job. Without the horse, I’d be pretty lost mentally. I normally have him partially leased out to help with costs but I’ve been unable to find a lessor and It’s been over a year without one...

Lastly, I am having trouble finding a roommate. I had to get out of a bad living situation in a very short period of time and the only place that I found to go where I would feel safe was a few hundred dollars out of my price range. I had a roommate which was helpful but she relocated to a different state for school. Since my rental rate is high the rate to rent my spare room has to reflect that and I know that that is what is keeping people away.

I really should have a second job, as most of my coworkers do. Some work their second job on weekends and others work an entire shift after school somewhere but I just can’t bring myself to do that as I’d have virtual zero down time which I know I need to help stay both physically and mentally healthy.",Anxiety attack,Anxiety,4,b7xwo4,False

While my teacher is very kind to me and is working with me, there's one assignment I can't get through. It's a ""reader's theater"" and I'm doing it by myself. This means acting a little by myself, being stared at. I broke down on friday in front of her trying to do it, and the entire week before it I couldn't sleep well and would constantly find myself panicking and crying anytime I was left alone with my thoughts. I was picking at my skin and my fingers and pulling hair again, and I couldn't focus on my other classes so my grades took a bad hit, which causes me even more stress.

 So, after having an awful panic attack in front of my teacher, she offered to let me just record myself doing it this weekend in my home and send it to her. I still couldn't do that. I feel awful but every time I end up bursting into tears, my breathing has been awful and my chest hurts.

t2_mxjap,"Hey all! 

So I’ve had lifelong anxiety, got much better for a while without medication (not fully but no panic attacks for like 3-4 years except for rarely) and now in the past 6 months got worse again. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg which I have been taking for around 4 months now. I also have Xanax as needed. 

My question is about my boyfriend. We have been together for a couple years, and when we first met and for the first year of our relationship I was still in my “lower anxiety” phase. But then in October / November of 2018 I started having daily panic attacks again  and derealization / depersonalization again. After taking the lexapro, it has gotten better but is still pretty bad. And I can tell my boyfriend is pretty upset about it. He hasn’t ever liked it but when it first started happening he was more empathetic and trying to be understanding and worried for me. Now that it has gone on for so long I can tell he’s getting upset at me. He knows it’s something that is extremely hard for me to control, but he said to me today “I just want happy times” and when I asked him to clarify he said it just seems like I can’t ever enjoy anything because of my anxiety (which is true and literally one of my fears— that I will be so scared to live that I wont). 

For example, yesterday was really hard for me but I pushed myself and we went out to a little festival and rode those electric scooters. I really didn’t want to go because of my anxiety, but super glad I went because it was fun and I pushed through! However today, for him he brought up How anxious I was and how I wanted to leave like 20 minutes into us being there. Which I had told him I was feeling anxious and wanting to leave but that I didn’t actually want to and wanted to push through, the wanting to leave was just my anxiety. But based on what he said, he didn’t have as much fun as I did and actually I held him back from having as much fun as he could have. And over time I have seen how I do that because of my anxiety. Even a trip to the mall can sometimes be a hassle because I’m freaking out inside (but I’ll tell him).

So I’m just feeling super down and not sure what to do because I know my anxiety is pushing my boyfriend away but I can’t just get rid of it... although I want it to be gone and I’m trying. What can I do to make him happier? Should I refrain from telling him about my anxiety anymore? And just try to keep it to myself? I don’t want to hold him back from living his life and enjoying it to its fullest especially since he doesn’t have anxiety but I want to also experience things with him i just have such a hard time.

I've had anxiety for a while and I've never really done anything to deal with it because I'm too busy with extracurriculars and school. I also didn't tell my parents until recently because they both have a lot of difficulty understanding anxiety and stuff. I told them that I'd been having more  anxiety attacks than normal recently and that I'd been shaking a bunch and it was impacting my school work and stuff (bc I apparently think that's more important than my health). 

My mom thought it was bc I wasn't drinking enough milk and my dad yelled at me for being on my phone too much and giving myself anxiety (which isn't true). 

My parents are both super traditional Indian parents and my older brother is super successful like he's going to graduate college in 2 months and has a nice job lined up and blah blah blah so there's a ton of pressure on me. I think that my parents cause some of my anxiety. Should I tell them this? If so, how do I tell 2 people who don't understand stuff like this that they're causing some of my anxiety? 

To clarify, my mom and dad think that if I tell them everything about myself, my anxiety will go away. Also, when one of my friends almost committed suicide a a few years ago, their only reaction was to ask me why someone would do something that stupid (when they didn't know my friend's circumstances at all).

However, this semester has been worse than ever. I am in constant fear every day. I spend every waking moment of my day experiencing panic and dread about the work and social interactions I will face during the week ahead. I have trouble focusing on my work because I am so anxious. I have started missing assignments and turning in work late. I am worried I might fail out of my program. On days I have clinical I literally feel like I am dying. The whole day before is spent in absolute panic. I have stopped hanging out with all of my friends. I have nearly 100 conversations on my phone I have stopped answering due to anxiety, including conversations with family members and loved ones. Even going to class is hard because I am nervous and scared around my classmates. When I have a patient I am extremely scared to talk and interact with them. It has gotten to the point where I am so anxious I do not hang out with anyone and I do not enjoy any part of my day because I am constantly in panic. The panic never ends. There is always something.

When i can tell anxiety is anxiety i can ignore it (like if i’m scared to go to the first day of class) but sometimes when the anxiety comes from a very real danger it’s hard for me to tell if it’s anxiety or a bad feeling i should listen to. This happens to me every time i want to go to the gym at night, i keep thinking someone is going to take me in the parking lot or something and i mean that could easily happen so it’s hard for me to tell if it’s a “warning feeling” or anxiety. I think it’s important to pay attention to your intuition if you have a bad feeling about something BUT i keep listening to my anxiety because i’m scared it’s my intuition.

 My mom was near by so she picked me up and took me. They told me that there was nothing wrong with my heart but it was good that I came in since I took beta blockers for heart palpitations do to anxiety. I struggled for the next few weeks because I still felt faint. 

Then, only a couple months later my boyfriend was in a car accident. I wouldn't walk for 2-3 weeks. I was fainting again. I would sleep for 10+ hours a day for the first week. I went back to a doctor to make sure I was okay. They said i was medically fine. After about a month I was walking again, but had to work part time instead of full time. 

Now, we moved, I started a new medication and was laid off. I faint 3+ times a day if I do anything that remotely causes anxiety. So if I need to leave the house, you can bet that I'm going to faint. I'm sure you can imagine why this makes life difficult. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, is there anything that can help with it?

I really want a boyfriend, to have my first kiss and lose my virginity, etc. So I can get over the fear that I’ll be a virgin and alone forever. I feel so stupid to worry about these things but all I can think about these days are how I’ll probably be alone forever.

I got a few dating apps but I got stood up on the first time I agreed to meet with someone which really screwed my self confidence up. I also hate eating around others in fear of looking gross. I went on another date and when he tried to kiss me, I chickened out because he was older than me and I’m also worried that I will be bad at kissing.

So, I work, probably twice a week, part-time. For a while now, I have felt anxious, useless, and like I don't belong there.

It was especially bad this past week (I have a personal relationship with someone at work, and the other day I was trying to help by telling him something, but he still went to confirm anyway... I'm probably just being stupid, but that kinda hurt.. I ended up pretty much rushing out of work for a lunch break because my anxiety was getting bad. I even had to take a breather in the bathroom, which was a first for me..)

Today was the first day I felt it was a good day. Honestly I attribute a big part of it to the person I worked with today. He's an amazing mentor. He goes above and beyond answering my questions, and I feel like I've learned a lot from him in one day. He also doesn't make me feel like an outsider, or make me feel useless, and tells me he appreciates my help.

t2_368v5wdu,"**Disclaimer:** This is not a replacement to therapy, or medical treatment. This is just a handy mental tool which can be treated as a coping mechanism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Use a technique called semantic conversion. It’s pretty straightforward and useful in social and office settings.  
Social anxiety has a powerful core colored by the fear of being judged by others.

This manifests in all kinds of thoughts and an anxiety action-reaction. I say action-reaction because thoughts can cause anxiety and anxiety can cause unnecessary thoughts. In fact, at times, the two are just one homogeneous blob of discomfort.

Semantic conversion has 2 steps which handle the feedback system of thoughts and physical anxiety as well as behaviors such as social avoidance.  
Step 1: Mindfulness labeling  
Step 2: Constructive rephrasing

**Step 1 Mindfulness labeling:**

We are, by default, not very aware of our own thoughts, emotions, surroundings, and perceptions, biases, and physical responses.

You begin by noticing the details. Ask the following questions:  
1. What is it about the situation that is making me anxious?  
2. What are all the emotions I am feeling?  
3. Who are the thoughts related to?  
4. Do you actually know what people are thinking?  
5. Do they have a real basis for forming any judgment?

**Step 2 Constructive rephrasing:**

Now, articulate your thoughts and emotions with precision. It is important that you aim for precision. Learn new vocabulary if you need to. Suppose your feeling is captured by the thought ‘I feel like shit,’ mindfully label all the details and articulate it into something like ‘I feel ignored or judged because there is something wrong with me or I am dressed inappropriately.’

Add the emotional context- ‘I feel like an overwhelming spotlight is on top of me. This makes me conscious, self-aware, and critical.’

Once you’ve articulated your thoughts, it is time to rephrase them into something actionable. For example- I need to address this feeling and do something about it. Something that is in my control. Let me observe and see how others are dressed. Let me see if there is any real evidence of me being judged. I feel like I don’t know what to do, I should learn the skills.

This change is actionable. You can do something about it. This will help you **gain control**. You need it, and you \*are\* in control.

t2_27r1n0ul,"A cowardly dog is trapped in the corner… all it's life it's been beaten and the only reason it survived was by running away, hiding and whimpering. But now it's cornered, for the first time it can't escape… it now has no choice but to fight viciously for survival. This illustrates the desperate way that our damaged subconscious mind tries to hold on to power and control over us in an attempt to “protect” us and keep us “safe” from harm.
In our childhood the only choice we had was to run, hide or cower in fear. Now, as an adult we have dug deep into the depths of our psyche and we now understand our dysfunction… however, our minds still do not trust us to take control of matters that involve our emotional safety… as a result, it attacks us with convincing arguments that if we try we will fail, there's no point in trying, fighting back leads to pain, give up, run, hide, cower… our minds fill us with fear, dread, anxiety and depression… every and any debilitating emotion to stop us from doing what it feels is dangerous. That is, to confront our fears and try new healthier ways to cope and live. But now our subconscious mind is cornered, there's no way out… you have chosen to refuse to give up, it's you and the cornered animal and only one of you will survive. The problem is, that YOU are the cornered animal, and the only way you walk out is by taming the beast, domesticating it, letting it know that you are in control, letting it know that you are grateful for it keeping you safe the only way it knew how for so many years. But now, YOU are in control and you need to let your mind know that you will protect it now, and that you will not let bad things happen to it again.

Recovery vs Fear of the Unknown 

For those of us with any sort of childhood trauma, fear of the unknown is debilitating. Our childhood trauma taught us that certainty within any given situation is the most important thing. For us, uncertainty was seen as certainty that bad things would happen. Therefore in our lives today, as bad as depression and anxiety is, we are familiar with it… and trying something new,  or trying to do things differently  may fill us with more fear and apprehension, which in turn keeps us trapped in our familiar prison of depression and anxiety.

For me, this is a basic outline of my history.

Initial childhood trauma lasting 18 years.

Maladapted coping mechanisms formed:

•	Denial
•	Suppression
•	Distraction
•	Subjugation
•	Enmeshment
•	Underdeveloped sense of self 
•	People pleasing 
•	Approval Seeking
•	Validation seeking
•	Substance abuse
•	Self pity

After the initial trauma lasting 18 years, it was followed by over 20 years of living a false, people pleasing, codependent identity which ultimately culminated extreme and debilitating depression and anxiety.
For me, recovery meant:

Making a start at refusing to deny, suppress and distract myself from the fact that I have a problem.

Making a start at refusing to be subjugated, people please, approval seek or validation seek.

Making a start at giving myself praise, validation and approval.

My maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, co-dependency, approval and validation seeking all gave me a measure of pleasure and good endorphin release, albeit disfunctionally... therefore, as I started to eliminate maladapted coping mechanisms I started to experience less positive feelings and more stabilized and constant feelings of depression.

Understanding and Acceptance

Once you understand, in as much detail as possible, the precise links between your childhood trauma and your current behaviour and feelings, you might be lucky enough to transform your feelings of depression, anxiety and sadness into anger against the injustice of life itself... anger is a not to be underestimated important step to reach because it is a necessary driver of change... but even then you will not automatically experience joy, peace, calm and happiness... in fact, this type of appropriate anger can and will lead to cynicism, bitterness and resentment, and so it is important to move to the next step in your recovery which is acceptance.

Acceptance.

Acceptance of what happened in your childhood, acceptance of how those things made you who you are today, acceptance that you were and are not to blame for any of it, acceptance that you cannot change the past, acceptance that you are who you are in the now, acceptance that in the now you are the best version of you that you can be... acceptance of the fact that you now have determination to slowly improve your person and your life in frustratingly small steps, every day, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year... acceptance of the resolve to not give up come what may.

The thing is, most likely, your mind does not know how to feel safe, positive and happy in a normal way. At a default subconscious level your mind will want to revert back to denial, suppression, distraction, a desire to find meaning through enmeshment, self pity and substance abuse or another well established self destructive behaviours. The sad fact is, is that your mind does not yet know how to cope or exist in any other state other than sadness, depression and maladapted and dysfunctional ways of coping and feeling better about things. Therefore it is important to teach your mind new ways to cope with feelings of negativity and new and healthier ways to experience joy, pleasure and happiness... this will present a real challenge for you, because even on a conscious level, you may simply not know how. Initially, you may simply have to go through the mechanical motions of doing things that you know are suppose to make you feel better... like going for walk, doing something artistic, outdoor activities, social activities, listening to music that is happy, not jaded or angry music, or depressing love songs etc.

At times however, we may need to go back and feel the fullness of our pain so as to explore and learn from it, to heal it through resolution... but we cannot live in a state of pain. We may need to revisit feeling angry over the injustices of our life, but we cannot live angry... 

So balance is required, because although we want to live in a happy headspace, this does not mean slipping into denial, suppression and distraction.... it means that we have felt the fullness of our sadness and anger... we accept what we feel, we acknowledge our past and with that acceptance and acknowledgement, we now choose to engage in positive activities to teach ourselves how to be happy in a healthy way.

This being said, the first stage to reach from depression and anxiety is anger, because you are making the switch from flight to fight, but you don't want to stay angry or you will be consumed by cynicism, bitterness and resentment... so you need to move on to the next stage which is resolute acceptance... 

After that you need to establish a new set of personal boundaries, or a realm, or scope of life that you want establish to live within... to find joy within... to find personal fulfilment and meaning and purpose within. Establishing a new life within which you want to live.

Acceptance is important, but it is important to know and get well acquainted with and pursue the healthy things that you want and enjoy in life, that will help you to cope and recover further. 

An important thing to remember is that recovery will not mean that your life will ever be as though your childhood trauma never happened... it will never be how it was before you were debilitated by anxiety and depression... however, just because this may be the case, it does not mean that whatever life you choose to create won't be wonderful.

For me that means pursuing things like art, exercise, weight loss, happy music, lego, movies, gaming, fishing, camping, creativity, appropriate self love and self respect through proper personal hygiene, care, grooming, dress and helping others to better their lives purely for the joy of giving without falling back into co-dependent or people pleasing patterns.

At this stage you may question why? Why bother? You may fear that doing or pursuing these things is ultimately pointless and little more than distracting yourself with positivity. This may be true to a degree, but not entirely, and you will need to be able to recognize that your resistance to pursuing these things amounts predominantly to your own deep seated fear of failure when you try to effect change for the better... your mind may still be trying to hang on to the familiarity of depression and anxiety because it knows how to disfunctionally make you feel better and will always try to pull you back to familiar things to your own detriment because it is convinced that you will be better of with the dysfunction you know, than the uncertainty of doing something new that might fail.

Regret nothing, feel ashamed over nothing, feel guilty over nothing, the past has made you the good and insightful and thoughtful and compassionate person that you are. To regret, feel shame or guilt is to regret that you are who you are, to feel shame and guilt over who you are... which is little more than self hate. Life did not give you the love, nurturing and protection that you deserved... so accept that you are who you are due to a life that was not of your planning and control and was ultimately indifferent, random and cruel.

Armed with this acceptance, move forward and choose to be who you want to be... choose to do what you want to do... choose to live how you want to live... refuse to go on allowing life to happen to you... take charge and become the architect of your future... even if it's hard... even if it's scarey... even though it's unclear whether you will fail or succeed.

t2_1hz8vl4l,"TW: domestic abuse

have struggled with anxiety since I was in 4th grade. I caught myself crying over the silliest of things, all the time. It has only gotten worse.

It got really bad when I dated this guy for 5 years. Everything was going great for the first half of our relationship - we were that picture-perfect couple that everyone wanted to be. To keep a long story short, we had a falling out and broke up. We talked everything through months later and decided to get back together. I thought everything would be fine. 

I was dead wrong. 

He started physically abusing me. He started calling me every name in the book. He told me that he was the only person that would ever love me - he convinced me that my mother, my father, my sister, my brothers...all hated me, and it was an “obligation” to treat me right because I’m part of the family and it would be “f**cked up” to blatantly tell me that they didn’t love me. I was fully convinced. And I guess I just haven’t been able to shake it yet. He left me shortly after our 5 year anniversary. 

Now, I am not saying that he is the reason I have anxiety - I was diagnosed with it for far more reasons than this. This just made it that much worse. 

I am now in a relationship of 3 months with this wonderful guy that takes awesome care of me. I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. But I catch myself, almost every night, not being able to sleep from anxiety. Anxiety of him leaving. Anxiety that he just doesn’t love me anymore and questioning who would even love me to begin with. I have talked to him about it once or twice and he has reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he loves me - but I still can’t shake it. I shake, I get nauseous, and I get that lump in my throat that tells me to cry but I can’t. So I just stare at the ceiling and hope it passes. 

I have two best friends that I wouldn’t trade for the world, and I am even convinced that they don’t like being around me anymore. I’ve isolated myself, I’ve stopped answering phone calls from them, I’ve bailed on them. I feel like an awful friend, but I feel like I seriously just can’t freaking help it. I’ve mentioned it to them and they’ve also reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, but it’s like there’s a devil on my shoulder telling me that they’re lying.

I get weird about my breathing, especially in public places like a classroom or movie theater. My vision is blurred nowadays from the lack of sleep, and my body is hyper sensitive to everything. I'm constantly fatigued, and I'm struggling to deal with everyday tasks.

Two nights ago I tried Diphenhydramine as a sleep aid, and it worked... But now last night it didn't work, even after taking a Benedryl with it like a pharmacist had suggested.

I'm not on any medication and hadn't been for years, but it just seems like things are spiraling out of control. I can't sleep for shit, much less want to be in a classroom. I used to enjoy sleep so much... I don't know why everything went to shit the way it did. It's been like this for weeks now. I'm debating on seeing a psych, but psychs have always made me nervous especially due to a previous Benzodiazepine addiction. At night my mind just races and paces along with my heart, and I can't even think properly like I used to. I could daydream and think about anything, but the brain fog has made everything uncertain.

I have an exam Wednesday I'm sure, and yet I can't even get out of bed to go turn in assignments in my damn Math 053 class. I've tried melatonin, blue light filters, strict bed time schedules... I just don't get why everything is going to shit or how to stop it. Depression is ruining any enjoyment of leisure activities I might have as well.

Recently however, probably a week ago, it was about 1am and I was on the computer playing a game, listening to music, the usual stuff. 


Out of nowhere something snapped in my head. Like you’d see in movies. Every single thought possible came to my mind. From why my life is good and bad, who loves me and who hates me, why I do things I do, funny celeb moments, memes, future plans.. EVERYTHING. No exaggeration. I had to get off the computer and lay down, I couldn’t stop. I was out of control. I tried turning music up, tried distracting with videos, even tried watching porn in hopes it would just make it stop.


It wasn’t a normal anxiety attack though or just the normal racing thoughts. Something was very strange about it. My chest kept getting hot with every thought. But I never “broke down” which felt worse than actually breaking down. I never got any relief like I would with crying/venting.



It has to this day been my worst experience and it’s a brand new symptom for me that I feel will put me in the hospital one day. It might be the one thing that gets be back to getting some help/therapy.

A month ago, I learned that my dear son was making suicidal gestures with a rifle.  He had done so in the past including a few times with a loaded rifle.  The last time he did so, he was online with a friend, the rifle was not loaded, but the friend reached out to her mom, then guidance counselor, and then we found out through the school.

Since then, he has been in intensive inpatient therapy, and now is in outpatient therapy.  He is doing well, scaling his days on a better than fair scale.  He says he feels better and behaviorally he is far more engaged with friends and family.  All guns, rifle and ammo were removed and are stored offsite and he does not know where.

Things were moving along fine until about a half hour ago.  I was driving to work and I got images of coming into his room and finding that he had shot himself.  I don't have any specific images, just seeing his body, and blood and the gun.  It is almost as if the enormity of how close we came to losing him, and how oblivious we were to how close we were, is starting to hit me.  This came out of the blue.  I am literally sitting here, typing at work with tears running down my face.

We are also in family therapy- group therapy and all sorts of professional support.  For his sake, we have chosen to not disclose to immediate family as it would also trigger too much drama and interference at this point.

I just have to put this thought here.  And I am going to murder this thought.  I am killing this awful bloody thought.  I am eliminating it from my mind, as much as I can and will not allow it to have a moment further energy.  It didn't happen.  We found out in time.

It seems like every time I’ve needed to leave my house over the last few days my anxiety sky rockets, sweaty palms, nausea and just a general sense of anxiety and not being able to breathe. 

I’m due to start a new job, which is also a university course in May. I didn’t think I was anxious about this, but maybe it’s what set it off? 

I was supposed to be spending the day with my boyfriend in the town about 20 minutes away, but as soon as I got to the bus stop I had to come home. He came to my house to sit with me and calm me down, which helped massively, and encouraged me to get onto the bus with him. I managed to, but as soon as I got into his town I got super anxious again, nausea, shaking,  dizziness and couldn’t breathe. We stopped in a pub near the bus stop where I called my mum (my saviour) and I decided I needed to go home. 

I can’t thank my boyfriend enough for what he does for me, and today was the first time he’s seen my anxiety this bad.

I don't smoke, I don't have a high blood pressure(not that I know) there's no possible reason why I would have a heart disease. Except stress? There's exams now but the school doesnt stop the after school activities. Doesn't help that I have an important biannual competition coming up.

Nope. At least in his case.

My boyfriend works in a factory where loud noises are basically ubiquitous, and he has to wear earplugs to protect his ears. The problem arises when I pick him up from work, and he speaks at really high volume. While in the car. Which is a really small space that amplifies sounds because small.

It's awful, trying to drive home while he's either practically shouting in the car, or fooling around on his phone and randomly bursting out into loud, sudden laughter. It's not as bad at home, as we tend to hang out in different rooms, but he has a very bad habit of making fun of how quietly I usually talk. Sometimes he even leans in and goes ""WHAT?"" really loudly if I'm too quiet. It startles me every time, and some days it ratchets my anxiety up to 11.

I have tried dozens of times to ask him to please stop doing that, but he usually forgets by the next day, or he doesn't understand why it bothers me and doesn't make an effort to stop. I don't know what to do about it. And it makes no sense that he complains about being sensitive to loud noises when he, himself, is a loud noise almost all the time.

I'll have a night of really bad anxiety, maybe have an attack and then I'll just be lethargic and depressed for the rest of the following day. I had one of those days Saturday evening and Sunday morning. But Saturday night I talked to my mom and she urged me to set up an appointment and she even cut me a check for it. 

I had a dentist appointment that was the source of a lot of my anxiety and while in the waiting room stressing I decided to text the therapist and she got back to me and set up a meeting for today (Tuesday). I feel like doing that at the height of my anxiety really helped me get through the dentist appointment and the migraine to follow. (I just got crowns on my front teeth. Yay... more anxiety fighting because before I was afraid to smile and have people see my dying tooth) 

This morning I determined my anxiety would make me do two things to avoid the appointment. I wouldn't get out of bed, and I'd feel crappy about myself and not want to get ready. So I made myself get up earlier even though the appointment was in the afternoon, and I proceeded to spend my morning cleaning my room and hanging up some pictures I had been meaning to get to. Definitely helped get myself out the door. 

For the appointment itself I was internally playing out the rick and morty episode ""pickle Rick"" thinking about all the other tasks at home I could be doing instead of being here. I sat in the car for a bit but I went in on time. 

I hadn't been emotional all morning but of course the moment I started trying to talk I choked up. Embarrassed I tried to hide it, and of course I started holding my breath, because I knew if I let it out I'd start hyper ventilating.

She asked about medications if I was interested and ended up suggesting essential oils and physical exercise. (I.e. running/jogging for me). There's some pseudoscience and mlm scams when it comes to essential oils but I know no shortage of distributors in my circle.

Ive always been anxious every now and then, but I’ve not been well for what seems to be 2-3 consecutive months now. I had several blood labs done to rule out any sort of disease, and they all came back normal. I was given propranolol to use when I feel anxious, but that never worked. I was then given Hydroxyzine; which made me feel a bit better, but that’s no longer the case. A few days ago, I stood in front of a crowd while somebody presented me a certificate, and I damn near almost fainted. I’ve always hated being the center of attention, but the feeling of almost fainting is brand new to me. 

The next day I went to a ceremony and had to leave once I saw how many people were in attendance. I ended up leaving and driving to a nearby city for the weekend.

The day after, I was trapped  in a car with 5 people in the back and it felt like I had a panic attack. We went to the movies, and it happened again, with the addition of weak arms and some dizziness. I walked a bit outside to calm myself and we ended up going into the theatre. I tried to sleep through the movie, but I couldn’t because of the general uneasy feeling and muscle twitches. I eventually left and fell asleep.

2 hour drive back home I felt as if the inside of my body was buzzing, so, I immediately took the Hydroxyzine when I made it to my apartment, but it seemed to have no effect.

Fell asleep after laying in bed for a half hour, and for the next few days, the uneasiness and buzzing would not stop.

Last night, I was laying on my couch and suddenly felt my head and hands shaking. I stood up and it seemed to go away until I laid down again. I decided to suck it up and sleep, which is where things got weird.

I have absolutely 0 idea if this was a reality or a dream, but in the moment, I felt shaking on one side of my face which, in a few seconds, led to my entire body violently shaking, and I remember not being able to breath well. From what I remember, this lasted about 10 seconds.

I reached for the phone, not knowing if what just happened was real or not, and saw that it was 2am. I honestly don’t even know if I had woken up from a dream or if that actually happened.

I felt normal and went back to bed. Now here I am at work, still feeling the buzzing, and terrified of what I just experienced.

t2_71gt57y,"Of course anxiety isn't really funny, but here's a couple stories that make me laugh from when I was younger.

So I have had extremely bad anxiety (primarily social) since about 5th grade. My anxiety peaked in 7th grade. I was so self conscious and I could NOT do anything in front of others. It was so bad that if I knew I had to say even a single word in front of the class, I would skip school or do anything to get out of it.
My last name starts with the letters AB, and my school always did everything alphabetically by last name. I was ALWAYS first, for everything. This includes swimming class. So, one day, I try to get out of swimming class by telling my gym teacher I didn't have my swimsuit. She was excited to tell me that she had one I could use.

Guess what color it was?

White. I bet you can guess why that's a problem. Of course 7th grade me didn't make that connection, sucked it up and went in the pool. You could see everything under that swimsuit. I still believe she gave me that one on purpose cause she hated me. Oh, and guess who had to be the one to demonstrate swim strokes in front of the whole class? Me. Yup. In a white see-through swimsuit. You bet I never went to a single swim class after that. It was traumatizing at the time but it makes me laugh now.

On to the next story (and my favorite).

It got to the point where I just couldn't go to school anymore because my anxiety was so bad. I just couldn't do it. I missed so many days of school that I had to go to court and my family was threatened with losing me. I ended up having to do community service. I was only 12! And nobody understood that it was anxiety causing me to miss school. I actually liked school itself. Just not being... around people. Anyways, so after I went to court I knew my family wouldn't let me stay home. But I sure as hell wasn't going to gym class, hell no! I came up with a plan. The night before school I loaded my backpack with donuts and snacks. Packed some warm clothes. I took the bus to school in the morning but instead of going into the school, I went behind the school and sat in a bush. For hours. Eating donuts. In the middle of winter. Just to miss gym class.

Eventually I decided I had skipped most of the classes I couldn't handle and went inside the school. I was immediately informed that the police were looking for me because the school called to inform my parents of my absence. Rip.",Hope this will make you laugh.,Anxiety,21,bjfdzn,False

* Working at a steady job (though boring and unfulfilling) that I've held for the last 5 years
* Have a decent amount saved (enough to pay for a year's rent)
* Other than a car, don't really have any ""assets"" to my name
* Usual   basket case of anxiety-related disorders: panic attacks, depression,   OCD, perfectionism, hypochondriac, agoraphobia/social anxiety, death   anxiety, don't like being alone for too long or with people for too   long, don't like being alone at night, intrusive thoughts, etc.
* Otherwise I'm quite physically healthy (had a slew of recent tests to establish this)
* Not very social and don't have many regular friends or hobbies
* I'm not on any medication (and haven't been)

I'm   reaching that point in my life where I feel I just need to do  something  different (as this usual routine of mine is not going to  solve things)  and I keep coming back to the idea of moving out and  living on my own. I  would be renting, as buying is not possible at the  moment.

Obviously,   it's going to be a challenge, but what I fear the most is being alone   at night, in a house all by myself and having those terror-inducing   thoughts that make me freak out. Whether it's being terrified of someone   breaking in, the house catching fire, having a heart attack alone,   choking to death on food, etc.

I   just know my mind is going to go there, because it already does when I   live in my usual, relatively comfortable environment and have someone  to  rely on for emotional support.

Take   away those crutches I fall back on and I can see myself struggling to   sleep through the night and becoming incredibly anxious about the most   mundane things that ordinarily I can handle quite well.

What   is there that can make me see that this will get better and that  living  alone by myself doesn't have to be so daunting and overwhelming?

I   do think it is the only way for me to feel in control of my life and   responsible and that the confidence gained will allow me to aspire to   achieve other things (like a better job and another relationship) but   thus far, every time I've come really close to moving out and signing a   lease, I always back out at the last minute because I feel so worried   that I'm making a mistake and that I won't be able to live by myself.

t2_vfdbi,"A good example is what just happened about half an hour ago. My husband went out to get some shopping, and I made some lunch for myself and my 4 year old son. When I went back into the kitchen all the electricity was off to all the plug sockets. Panic sets in. Is it just the kitchen or the whole house? TV is still on so its just the kitchen. Then realising that this means the fridge and freezers are now not being powered. I can't remember where the fuse box is so I can check the circuit breakers. OK, time to phone my husband for help. He doesn't answer the phone. I repeatedly call about 5 times, no answer. I send messages ""Answer the phone!"" and ""Call me its IMPORTANT"" because the fridge is off and obviously all the food is going to spoil and I don't know how to fix it and WHY ISN'T HE ANSWERING THE PHONE MAYBE HE'S BEEN IN A CAR CRASH AND DIED.

Now I'm in near full panic but trying not to show it to my son, I decide to look in the cupboard and see a big box. I've found the circuits, and therefore can get power back to the kitchen. One problem solved. I try to phone my husband again and now he picks up. He had his phone on silent. I quickly explain everything that's happened and he says he's sorry for not answering.

All in all I end up feeling stupid for getting so panicked over a power loss that was easily fixed and for instantly drawing the conclusion that an unanswered phone means something horrible has happened.

t2_1oq2r6d5,"My wife suffers from anxiety.  We have two little kids.  Between that and just life, her anxiety tends to get triggered at least every other day. When she has an attack, she tends to get mean.  Almost always that meanness is directed at me.  She’ll talk to me disrespectfully and she is unfair.

In the past, I’ve tried to just let it slide.  I try to keep in mind that this is the anxiety and not her, but it’s hard when it happens so often.  I’ll say “I’m sorry that your anxious” to try and sign to her that she is being nasty to me, but she has trouble managing the attacks.  She works with a therapist, and she definitely has more control than she used to, but she still struggles quite a bit.

I wonder if letting it slide is doing more harm than good?  I’d prefer to not be around her when she is having an attack, but with the kids, it’s tough.  A lot of times I’ll ask her to leave to calm down, but since her anxiety stems from the kids, she has trouble leaving them.  And I have trouble leaving her with them when I know she’s already in an anxious state.  She and her therapist ask that I try to be supportive during these attacks, but when I try to offer help, she tends to be nasty back at me - it makes me not want to be nice.

t2_2k5k4nga,"Hi Reddit. I’m working towards my masters of Education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling currently and am also working full time doing program support at a University. I’m on my second year of coursework and my program is 100% in an online format. I graduated from undergrad in 2015 and went back to school in 2018. 

Since I’ve gone back, I have experienced severe anxiety related to performance and other random topics related to school. For example, have I paraphrased this well enough? Am I covering what the assignment is asking of me? I’m asking a LOT of what if questions. It’s constant. I don’t feel any form of relief until I have my grades back. For me, it isn’t about the grade. I don’t mind not making perfect scores. 

There is no former evidence of any poor performance in my studies. I’m actually extremely smart and driven and I take pride in the work I put out. I ask questions when I need to and I’m used to going the extra mile. But I’m so tired of this constant feeling of “doom” that is present. It makes getting through my readings and assignments extremely difficult. If the anxiety gets bad enough, which it often does, I’ll go into a major depressive episode. 

I’ve been diagnosed with MDD and GAD for quite some time. I’m seeing an incredible psychiatrist and I have struggled to find a therapist I connect with in the city I am, but saw one last week that I’m hoping is the right one. As someone who is studying the field, I feel like I need CBT but I also just think I need to do some self-compassion work. 

I’m about half way done with my program and cannot continue to work through the courses in this much of an anxious state. I’m thinking about taking short breaks in between my courses so I have time to re charge. Anyway, trying to sort it all out and take cRe of myself at the same time.

I thought I was the only one with this until I started talking to a friend who said that he was struggling with anxiety really bad and he told me he was experiencing the exact same feeling! He even also went to the doctor and got told there was nothing wrong.

* 30 years of age
* Single (last relationship ended a year ago)
* Living with my mother
* Never moved out or lived with anyone other than family
* Working at a steady job (though boring and unfulfilling) that I've held for the last 5 years
* Have a decent amount saved (enough to pay for a year's rent)
* Other than a car, don't really have any ""assets"" to my name
* Usual    basket case of anxiety-related disorders: panic attacks, depression,    OCD, perfectionism, hypochondriac, agoraphobia/social anxiety, death    anxiety, don't like being alone for too long or with people for too    long, don't like being alone at night, intrusive thoughts, etc.
* Otherwise I'm quite physically healthy (had a slew of recent tests to establish this)
* Not very social and don't have many regular friends or hobbies
* I'm not on any medication (and haven't been)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm    reaching that point in my life where I feel I just need to do   something  different (as this usual routine of mine is not going to   solve things)  and I keep coming back to the idea of moving out and   living on my own. I  would be renting, as buying is not possible at the   moment.

Obviously,   it's going to be a  challenge, but what I fear the most is being alone   at night, in a  house all by myself and having those terror-inducing   thoughts that  make me freak out. Whether it's being terrified of someone   breaking  in, the house catching fire, having a heart attack alone,   choking to  death on food, etc.

I   just know my  mind is going to go there, because it already does when I   live in my  usual, relatively comfortable environment and have someone  to  rely on  for emotional support.

Take   away  those crutches I fall back on and I can see myself struggling to   sleep  through the night and becoming incredibly anxious about the most    mundane things that ordinarily I can handle quite well.

What    is there that can make me see that this will get better and that   living  alone by myself doesn't have to be so daunting and overwhelming?

I    do think it is the only way for me to feel in control of my life and    responsible and that the confidence gained will allow me to aspire to    achieve other things (like a better job and another relationship) but    thus far, every time I've come really close to moving out and signing a    lease, I always back out at the last minute because I feel so worried    that I'm making a mistake and that I won't be able to live by myself.  I   just can't make that leap of faith.

t2_2h4a2shf,"This is actually my first post on reddit so I want to apologize in advance if this post doesnt follow normal protocol or if I'm breaking any rules. I'l try to start with some context which I think is relevant. Growing up I was always quite confident, I had numerous extracurricular leadership positions in high school and was always very sociable. I would go out to party's almost every weekend and was quite a heavy drinker, this continued into University. My first year at University I kind of developed an eating disorder? I would eat very little or nothing at all for a few days then go out and drink till I passed out. The next day or couple of days I would binge eat. In my second year I started experimenting with drugs, it started off mainly with MDMA and ecstasy, I started using it almost every time I went out. At the end of second year I started using cocaine and ketamine as well. By third year I was using all three and most often mix them in the same night. IE I would start the night by drinking, then take some MDMA then some COKE then some Ketamine and then fall as sleep by smoking a joint. It's also perhaps worth noting that I smoked for two years at university but have since stopped. Whilst at University I also had two family deaths, where one was self-inflicted. My symptoms really became a problem about a year ago, I was on holiday with my girlfriend where we were drinking almost every evening and one morning I had a really bad episode or attack. It usually creeps up on me, it will start out of nowhere and can be triggered by any change in environment. When it happens I feel almost panicked and I'm not sure why, but for me the worst sensation is that I feel disconnected from whats going on and as If I'm going to feint at any moment, I also struggle to focus on anything, and my vision almost becomes blurry. If its a really bad episode then I get an upset stomach as well. When I have an attack I become most afraid of my heart and I fear that I will have a heart attack, part of this concern comes from the fact that my family has a history of heart failure. Another symptom I get almost daily is this strange pressure on my chest, as if something is pushing on it. It makes me constantly tug at my shirt to get it away from touching my chest. I finally went to the doctors about 7 months ago and basically broke down crying because I didnt know what was wrong with me and it was the first time I kind of acknowledged that something was going on. The doctor sent me to see a cardiologist where I did numerous ECG's and blood work and it all came back fine, nothing wrong. The doctor didn't follow up with me and I didnt have the courage to make another appointment to admit the symptoms to her all over again. So what I decided to do is to completely stop drinking, I haven't drank since January and I havent had a major attack since then, but I do still experience the more minor symptoms where I can't focus on anything. Other triggers include when I dont eat properly or if I drink too much caffeine. Maybe its also worth noting that I'm a really active person, I do a lot of exercise, sometimes when exercising I feel a bit feint but I usually force myself to continue.

t2_c53l2xs,"I was formally diagnosed and saw a therapist for social anxiety almost 10 years ago. Things were on the up and up it seemed, and then this year it's kicked in almost full gear again, combined with general anxiety. 

And I feel like either I'm more aware of my triggers, or I have developed new ones. This is very fun to learn... *eyeroll*

For instance, I love coffee, I was even up to 4 cups a day before. But lately, even 1-2 cups can get my anxiety turned up to 11. Drinking tea or decaf is a big lifestyle and identity change. 
I also do a lot more anticipatory worrying about fairly mundane tasks than before, to the annoyance of my SO.

But on a positive note, I don't feel as anxious when asking strangers questions or making phone calls. Still there, but not as strongly (I would previously avoid, now I rehearse a bit) as before.

I think that I've made a *lot* of progress considering where I started. Less stuttering and stammering, less time put into fretting over whether or not my listeners hated me for what I said during my last talk break.

For example: 
My brother was very overweight as a child, I remember making fun of him and rubbing it in his face when I was eating chocolate cake.. I don’t remember my age but it makes me feel disgusting and so horrible ..I bullied my brother a lot, we have a strained relationship and I’ve called him stupid, pathetic, loser even recently..like maybe 4-5 years ago. He’s a drug addict with behavioral issues and it kills me that I wasn’t more empathetic and understanding, even tho he did make it quite difficult I know that underneath all these issues he is a good person who is just very insecure and sad 

When I was around 13-14 my dad and I would make plans to watch movies and on those nights a lot of the time he would end up sitting on the couch until he fell asleep..waiting for me to come down Bc I was too distracted by my computer ..I don’t know why this one is making me cry as I type...my parents are both such wonderful kind understanding people and I have no idea how they ended up with a child as awful as me 

My mom went on a business trip for 3 weeks when I was around 7, she brought me home a bunch of toys and instead of saying thank you I said “next time, can you get ___ instead”

When I was a kid I was weird about showing affection, I’m not sure why as I had a healthy home life and a family who loved me..but I loved playing tricks on my grandpa and scaring him and stuff ....I also used to play sims for hours at his house instead of spending time with him...I couldn’t have been older than 12 when I was doing this but it still makes me so sick to my stomach..my grandpa lived far away and I never made an effort to call him on his birthday, when his mind started to go it made me too nervous to see him so I pretended nothing was going on until he passed away 

Another thing, when I was a child I was very “cute” and loved getting gifts and attention from distant family and my parents friends ...I remember once I pressured my poor brother into asking one of my dads friends  if she had any presents for us.. my brother didn’t want to but I kept pressuring him ..he’s 4 years older than me but very immature for his age and quite impressionable ..he crumbles under pressure and I took advantage of that and I couldn’t have been any older than 8, I don’t understand how an 8 year old was capable of being so horrible 


It’s no excuse but I’d like to add that on top of severe anxiety I have a lot of neurological disorders, and as a child I had such severe behavioral issues that it I had trouble socializing properly and would constantly be getting in trouble without understanding why whatever I was doing was wrong. I have many family members on the spectrum and honestly suspect I could be as well..it’s just that since reaching adulthood I’ve developed a lot more empathy, so much so that I feel I am constantly hyper aware the emotions of others.

t2_3vcstywt,"I tried to change myself. I also tried to change my life. And depending how your life is, that may be something worth doing. But for me it didn't work at all and probably made things even worse. Because to me. Change. Is. Terryfying.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember how long I ""tried to"" change things. More than ten years probably. Including but not limited to: being more productive, being more social/communicative, getting to know new people, keeping in touch with old people, being more self-confident, being fitter, exercising regularly, eating healthier, cooking my own food, fixing my sleeping schedule, living healthier in general, producing less waste, travelling more, reading the news more thoroughly, reading more books, practicing the piano more, spending less time on the internet etc.

&amp;#x200B;

And with all these things, I dreamed big. I was young and I thought, the sky is the limit. Ten years gone by. The success rate: nearly zero. Let's be honest: zero. With the usual ups and downs, all those things actually got worse. Until last year. But before I get into my small successes since then you might say I am too hard on myself. That there is no way everything went downhill the last ten years. And you are right. I achieved a lot and nearly all of it due to social pressure. Yeah, social pressure is great in general to replace discipline. In my experience it doesn't work long term though. In the end lazy habits were stronger than self-imposed social pressure and discipline didn't want to build up fast enough. So I read about motivation and discipline and made so many plans, set up mantras and signed imaginary contracts with myself and abided none of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how I see it. Due to my anxiety, I am afraid of change. Changing things is so exhausting, that after a few weeks maximum I kind of have to fall back into my old habits. That's why I don't want to change. So, you think, my answer is just: Accept the way you are and be happy? Yes and no. If I had just done that, I probably would have lived the last ten years happier with the same outcome. But the outcome is still bad. This is the big ambiguity in my life that brought me to the verge of despair: How can I accept the way I am while constantly being encouraged to change for the better at the same time? Simple answer: Too much media consumption fucks up your brain and its expectations of life in our society. But that's not my topic.

&amp;#x200B;

What about my successes in the last year? I stopped trying to change things. We always hear about getting out of our comfort zone. To jump into the cold water. If the anxiety is too strong though, you won't jump off the 10 feet diving tower, whatever people tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my successes is doing push-ups, pull-ups and squats. A few sets of a few each at least twice a week now. Sounds pathetic for someone exercising seriously but for me it's a success. I started from being able to do two single correct pushups a few months ago. My motivation was not to become muscular or fit. I also didn't aim for doing like 50 push-ups in a row or 100 push-ups a day or something stupid like that. I was rather interested in learning to do push-ups. I didn't make plans how to proceed. After a few weeks I could do ten in a row and I started adding pull-ups and soon after I added squats without weights. In terms of strength I now feel as fit as I felt over five years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I could have joined a gym. With a professional trainer I could have had the same sucesses after weeks not after months. I know that. I could have done that ten years ago. But I haven't. Because I stood at the edge of the diving tower and jumping was too scary. And if you can't rely on people throwing you into the water(social pressure) over and over again, what can you do? Take a run-up. For me, doing two single push-ups was the start of my run-up. Just start and proceed so slowly, that you don't realize getting faster. Until you're so fast in the end you couldn't even stop at the edge if you tried to.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. I know it's nothing revolutionary. Who knows if I carry on with my run-up. And if I do who knows, if I ever get to the jump in the end. But that is my point actually. Everyone will tell you to start slowly if you want to change. For me it's about not even trying to change. Not even knowing if there is a jump at the end. When I don't expect to change things, I change the most apparently. So I will continue to take run-ups and see where they will lead me.",Fear of change and how I deal with it,Anxiety,1,bvjqsw,False

I'm really not sure where to post this but I'm in a really bad place right now when it comes to fitness. I am currently on a cut and have been training for 5 few years now but only just started being extremely consistent over the last year. 

Over the last 2 months (started when I started counting calories) my anxiety has been through the roof. After every gym session I'm evaluating whether I worked hard enough (I could collapse but still persuade myself that I could have worked harder) and i can feel myself developing an eating disorder. I'm constantly opening my fitness pal to ensure that I know my calories even though I have checked them hundreds of times in a day and I panic if I eat anything un-planned. Anyway it's all starting to take its toll, I have been ill the last couple of days, I have absolutely no motivation and/or energy to go to the gym and I can't sleep...for the first time ever I walked in and straight back out of the gym yesterday....I just didn't want to be there.

I'm planning on taking a week off but I'm not sure if this is the best move as if I lose muscle it might tip me over the edge. But at the same time I think taking a week off might really help reset my mind and body and make me realise what's important to me.

I know I should probably be finding better distractions, but often when I try to focus on something else like reading, it’s a lot harder to keep my mind from wandering or feeling anxious again. Another thing that could probably help is being around people more and/or trying to get involved in more stuff, but that can be hard because unfortunately I don’t have too many friends who live nearby and it’s difficult to put myself out there because of, you know, the anxiety that I need to be distracted from in the first place.

I don’t want to sound defeatist, I just think that often the suggestions people give for getting away from looking at a screen can be tough for people with anxiety, and that’s why I’m hoping people here have maybe been in the same boat and will have some thoughts—whether you’ve found something that works for you, or just want to commiserate, lol.",Using technology as a distraction from anxiety?,Anxiety,74,bvlzyt,False
t2_3vduhjev,"Hello! I just want to ask if my constant nervousness and worrying is still normal? I legit get worried about everything! 
   E V E R Y T H I N G. 

Like, walking down the street, I get so nervous even though I'm just walking like everyone else! I feel like everyone is watching me and they are talking about me (even though they don't know me and I don't know them). I also feel like what if the way I walk is embarassing? What if my way of walking is incorrect? (If there's such a thing). 

And I'm so paranoid. One time I woke up and I saw nobody downstairs, my immediate thoughts are: ""What if someone broke into our house and took them?"" and ""What if they are dead upstairs? And the killer is just there.."" and many more thoughts, all were negative. 

I'm so scared that time, I'm just sitting and looking at the stairs. Tempted to go up but too scared to do so. Then after a few minutes, I saw my Auntie going down the stairs- normal, alive and breathing. 

Nothing bad happened. 

Looks like she's just doing some errands upstairs and my grandfather is peacefully sleeping. 

Then after that, I relaxed. 

That's just one of the many moments were my thoughts are severely negative. 

Plus, every night, everytime I hear the sound of an airplane I feel like it's going to crash into our house. And I think that what if it's a meteor closely hitting us? (it may sound funny but I think like that every time I hear that sound). So I end up shaking and covering my ears hoping that it will just stop. 

And... I always feels like I'd die anytime. Literally. And it's so scary that sometime I come to a point that I don't want to do any thing and just lie there because I find everything useless...since I'm gonna die.

That's all. I'm sorry if this post is too messy to understand? And I'm sorry too if there are LOTS of grammatical errors (english is not my first language :&lt; )

t2_16c8nh,"Let me start with the fact that I've always had anxiety issues, which I've gotten much better at controlling. My biggest issue is that I perform very well, except when I'm ""put to the test"". When I'm put to the test, I will get nervous and choke everytime and it's extremely frustrating. For example, I've boxed for years, and people and coaches alike have told me I'm extremely gifted. At a bar there was one of those arcade punch bag machines, which I just got nervous and literally missed, whereas I can hit a speed bag for days when I'm by myself. 

Every since I was young I was very good at playing basketball and making shots. In actual games, I choked and made 0. It's like even if I'm not nervous, a different part of my mind begins to think and not react.

Or, I'm very fast, and when racing someone, I'll get shakes and fuck up the beginning. This is me and performance in general. I can never properly plan and carry out a confident scenario in my head, but when I'm impulsive and react I'm very smooth. I don't understand why I go through this, and how I can overcome in.

t2_5qpg5ix,"This is my first time posting and I don't know if making this post is the right thing to do, but I thought I would put things down into writing to get them out. Things are going well but I feel at some of my worst.

I'm about to graduate college as an honors student with summa cum laude and a job in data science, something I have been working towards for the past three years though school and internships. 

I start in a month but even getting through the day is a difficult. I had planned to go to Japan during the one month time before I start working, but I keep going back and forth on whether I should go. I was privileged enough to get a scholarship to go this past winter and it was an amazing feeling of adventure and freedom that I desperately want to experience again.

My mind keeps changing thinking about it. Is spending that money going to be worth it? I'm going to be going to the other side of the world while my mom is at home alone and having chronic pain. How can I leave her like that? I can't bring get with me everywhere but anything I do I have the thought in the back of my head that I don't deserve to enjoy while she can't. A bit back, seeing me bored out of my mind and sitting at home with nothing to do, she even encouraged me to go. Then, she changed her position and started asking what's the point and if it would be worth spending so much money. 

This feels like it's such an insignificant thing but at the same time, I want to go back and have that freedom being away from home. I want to have that feeling of adventure exploring new things. I grew up in a household that wasn't very happy. I watched my dad leave and my mom work day in and day out to take care of me and pay the bills. I appreciate all that she's done but I don't want to be eternally bound to her while not feeling like an unappreciative son. I want to be free and enjoy life like other people.

There are too many things I am worried about:
-I don't think I deserve to travel or enjoy myself while my mom can't and my dad is depressed. 
-I'm graduating soon but I feel like my dad and I will get into an agreement about how I'm not happy like he thinks I should be as he did at both my middle and high school graduations. 
-I have a job I never dreamed of but I can't help but feel like I'm making a mistake in going down this route and don't really have much of an understanding of what is right to do growing as the only son of first generation immigrants living in a very different and constantly changing world.
-I want to travel and feel like I did this past winter but I keep thinking it won't be worth it and the cost and leaving my mom alone outweighs the benefit, especially now that she is having chronic pain and issues walking the day after I booked the flight.

I'm stuck cycling between concern after concern until I get overwhelmed and feel forced to take lorazepam to calm myself down. Over a year of therapy and almost a year on antidepressants and things continue to feel hopeless. I don't know how I'm supposed to live when I feel powerless to change anything. I don't want to just put my head down and dissociate my way through life. I already don't remember much from years and years of childhood because I was just trying to get through it hoping for better days rather than being a kid. Now I'm in my early twenties and have never dated, gave up the college experience to stay close to my mom and save money, and regret living with my head down for so so long.

t2_o8zdgwn,"You perceive so much through a filter of fear. Stop this with just 2 steps:

1. Be aware of it. Be aware of the state of your mind and recognize when you’re being fearful.

2. Understand that you don’t have to live with fear. The purpose of fear is to keep you away from things that can harm you, but when there’s a) nothing there to harm you, or b) nothing you can do about the thing that could potentially harm you, fear loses it’s purpose and becomes nothing more than a nuisance. So simply choose to live without the fear. Ignore it and it goes away.

I know the last part sounds really r/thanksimcured, especially for more intense cases of anxiety, but that’s where mindfulness meditation comes in handy. 

By keeping attention at the breath, noticing when the mind gets distracted, then bringing attention back to the breath, you train your mind to do this automatically throughout the day with unwanted sensations.

t2_172mmw83,"Heads up,this is super long and I’m kind of all over the place from lack of sleep.

But Hello everyone!

I just came across this sub today upon reflection of underlying anxiety in everyday life. 

I know judging from the title this sounds like a very generic thing people go through from time to time, but I just wanted to get some other opinions and thoughts on the matter. Please limit responses to only constructive criticisms or advice, I get enough grief from my mom :) 

So here is some background.
I guess I would best describe my patterns of productivity to a yo-yo diet. 
From time to time I will have my moments of obsessive ambitions, and start off my projects with some commitment and a good attitude; some examples would be wanting to exercise and following a workout regiment to the T for the first week or so, or wanting to paint, thusly purchasing supplies and working on a canvas.

But then something happens overtime. 

The quality of my work degrades from what it started off as, I make excuses or occupy myself with other things, and then I have intrusive thoughts that discourage me from continuing to pursue completion of said project. It doesn’t always happen in this order, but I notice these are common events. 

That being said, I’m currently unemployed (was let go from budget cuts) and am a student living with my boyfriend who is a part-time worker and student. 

I’ve applied to many places and haven’t heard back. I know I can’t be picky with my choices, so I’ve just apply to wherever I can. But, when I start up the computer I just feel this sense of dread reviewing job options. 

I think about how much I’m going to hate talking to people. I stress about if my coworkers will like me or not, and I worry about balancing my school and work life. I also am consumed with fear of being unqualified or unprepared for the responsibilities from all the costly mistakes I’ve made in my prior jobs (messing up orders from anxiety, mishandling socialization/making serial social faux pas). But on top of that, I constantly hate myself for not being comfortable working. It’s not the principle of working itself that makes me upset, it’s that it seems everyone else is functioning, even thriving, in their work spaces with their coworkers and with their work obligations without any sense of doubt in themselves. I can’t help but look at myself and wonder “why can’t I be that competent like they are?”

All of this surmises to me generally feeling like I can’t accomplish anything and just passively avoiding things by being on Reddit (ta-da), other apps then scolding myself and feeling ashamed at bedtime because I haven’t done anything to directly improve my situation. 

It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard for me to push myself to participate in regular things, like hanging out with my boyfriend’s family at important milestone events or complete necessary chores. 

So here it is (finally): could this be described or attributed to anxiety and how could I best deal with this?

At one point on April, I felt my body shut down. I woke up one day super tired, nervous and felt like my heart was beating hard (not fast).

t2_3vesg0ln,"After being medicated on and off the past 17 years for anxiety and panic disorders, my new psychiatrist has made a compelling argument that my anxiety is due to adult ADHD. He convinced me to try Vyvanse in conjunction with Inderole, and also diazepam on hand as a last resort.

My initial reaction to this whole idea was skepticism. Sure, I do check a lot of the boxes for ADHD, but I've never tolerated stimulants that well. Amphetamines, in particular, can give me a nasty, dysphoric edginess at therapeutic doses.

The thing is though, the thought keeps occurring to me that much of my anxiety is situational.

I'm afraid to go outside, afraid to interact with people, and so I don't. I hide from these interactions and seek comfort and relief in benzodiazepines, which are sedatives. 

Consequently, I feel temporarily better... but I am less proactive. More unsolved problems seem to pile up, my outlook gets worse, and I eventually the benzos stop working. It's a vicious cycle that's probably pretty familiar to most people on this sub.

I recently quit my job because I was physically threatened by a coworker and management didn't care to intervene. The subsequent panic attacks were debilitating - but at the same time, it was a shit job and better things surely await. To get there, perhaps the motivation from a drug like Vyvanse can help me ""get ahead of the curve"" so to speak?

I seem to be a lot more motivated and getting things done, but I can already feel my nerves starting to fray a bit, and Vyvanse slight but steady edginess almost eclipses diazepam's effects entirely at times. It's not untenable, but it does seem a little counterproductive.

3. When I messaged and said I was going to the mall I said I wasn’t going to buy anything. I took the $50 with me. I bought the tops. They’re going to think I lied but I really wasn’t planning on buying any tops. 

Despite all of that, I love these tops. They’re soft and make me look and feel good about myself, rather than wearing something just to hide in. Why can’t it be that easy? Why do I have to cry over a couple of tops? That show 2 inches of stomach?

t2_10wa8j,"Hello, fellow redditors! I am new to this subreddit and it seems like a great place for me to share the issues I am facing with anxiety.

For the past few years, my anxiety has been difficult on me. Ever since I moved from my small hometown to a capital city for a new job, I have never expected that my anxiety level would get so severe. After working at that job for 9 months, I tapped out and resigned. 

Every work day is the same feeling; the moment I reached the parking lot of the office, I felt so difficult just to get out of the car to get my ass into the office. My heart would start beating like crazy and my palms and feet would get all sweaty. I has definitely affected my work performance and tbh, my boss was not pleased. I just couldn't keep myself grounded during my time there.

I figured I could take some time off before getting a new job, but I still get so anxious even though I just stayed at home all day. My anxiety stuck with me until I got a new job, which I worked at until two months ago, I got sacked from the company because I didn't turn up to work for a week straight. I felt so miserable I didn't have the mood to do anything but to stay home and do nothing.

My anxiety has never been so bad before, and I just want to understand it better so that I can, at least, learn to deal with it better without letting it affecting my work and social life...

But sometimes I get anxiety out of nowhere and deep down, I know how illogical it is, and I hate it.... but I still have it.

Although I was a little disappointed (I’ve never been to a party, or seen my boyfriend drunk, both of which I want to do), I understood he just needed time with his friends. 

But my anxiety... I’m freaking out worrying if he’s cheating, how’s he going to get home, is he okay... etc. Even THOUGH I KNOW HOW ILLOGICAL IT IS.

I hate it.

And then I tried to ask my friend if it was fair to be a little annoyed at him for disappearing without telling me his plans to get home... and she was like “just let him be an adult.”

I just wanted to be understood... I haven’t texted him at all because deep down, I’m totally fine with the party, I know he’s not stupid and that everything will be fine. But right now my anxiety is through the roof.

I’m usually the DD at parties because I don’t ever get super drunk (I hate the loss of control) but I like hanging out and having fun with people, to a certain extent. But after a period of time I get super drained - it can be debilitating if I surpass my limit and it’s worse when I know I can’t get home for a while. 

My anxiety has been insane lately and I’ve developed a fear of being alone. So I’ve been going out even if I don’t want to and doing whatever people I’m around want to do. It’s just been a distraction I guess, but I mostly still feel unhappy. 

Tonight I went to a party with my bf, and it was all people he knows. No one socialized with me, even when I tried to spark up a conversation. The bf quickly got drunk and started being all buddy buddy with everyone and getting belligerent, leaving me completely to my own devices. Which I wouldn’t have even noticed if I had anyone else there to talk to. I even tried to walk over and be a part of other groups but everyone including my bf ignored me. Not to mention, I feel like lately I’ve been babysitting every time we go out and it makes it not fun for me at all. I’m dragging everyone home at 2am while they can hardly stand and I’m the person that gets them into their apartments when they can’t even find their keys. 

It’s getting exhausting and of course I want my friends to have fun and I want to make sure they get home safely, but why am I always the thing between them stumbling around in an alley and being safe in their bed.

I knew I’d have to leave my bf there knowing he wouldn’t text me and would probably have to wander home in the middle of the night and get lost (this has actually happened)...and I feel good!

On mobile so sorry for editing or whatever

BUT let’s backtrack a little. A few weeks ago I started Adderall XR slow release to help with my racing thoughts. Before I was on 15mg then upped it to 20mg. Keep in mind, I am a 5’8 skinny white dude. I was spacing the medicine out every other day but two weeks ago I decided to take it back to back. Ever sense then, I’ve had crippling anxiety attacks. Making stuff up that isn’t even there, having to leave work early due to just not being there mentally and so on (Side note: I talked to my doctor about lowering the dosage and all. But to be honest, scares the shit out of me to even touch it) 

My girlfriend, we’ll call her Amelia. Amelia and I have been dating for about a month and a half and everything is going swimmingly well. But once these anxiety attacks started happening I started creating these nonexistent issues that weren’t even there. I started obsessing over things that didn’t need to be obsessed over. Amelia went to hang out with her coworker, we’ll call him George. George was showing Amelia a good time with his friends. Which is fine don’t get me wrong, but my mind took it to a place where it didn’t need to. Drove me nuts. Blew her phone up because I just needed to know what was happening. We talked it out and everything is cool now but ever sense that first really bad anxiety attack, they keep happening. I’m not sure if it’s side effects from the medication or me coming down from it or a combination of both or I’m just crazy. Typically driving at night helps and listening to music. I’ll call Amelia and we’ll talk it out but I just feel like I’m burdening her and I don’t want to do that. I’ve had anxiety before but NEVER this bad. These typically happen at night but sometimes during the day and it’s really random stuff that sets it off. I’m usually the “happy-go-lucky” guy but underneath the surface I can be a real hot mess. Amelia understands where I’m coming from and she’s incredibly patient with me and helps me work through it but I don’t want to burden her every time I’m having a bad night. Because lately, it’s been happening more and more. I hope these stop soon. Has anyone else gone through something similar?

I didn’t know what to do so i started harming myself. Once my mom found it, she got mad and made me stop but she never consoled me or asked me what made me do that. In high school, it would continue. I would get stressed and sad for really minimal things. In college, it also occurred and I didn’t know what to do about it. I don’t really talk about it with anyone besides my boyfriend and a couple of friends but I always try to hold back because I don’t want to trouble anyone with my issues or annoy them because this is an issue I’ve been constantly facing.

t2_ihn8q,"A little background: I have generalized anxiety, morbid OCD, PTSD, Social phobia and depression. Possible ADHD and autism. My biggest anxiety fear is loss of control, IE suddenly becoming crazy, hurting someone or just going mad. It's what drives most of my anxiety in day to day existence.

I've been on Busperione for nearly a month. By the 3rd it will have been so. I started with 10 mg twice a day for a week, now up to 3 times a day so 30mg in total per day. I have all the lovely side effects, but the worst of all was that it's made my anxiety and panic feelings a lot worse, like I have a constant almost unyeilding nervous energy 22/5 which is far worse at night. It's very frustrating, not only because from what I read, Busperione usually has the least bad side effects (I'm unlucky and getting some of the more uncommon ones, like gastral upset, brain zaps, muscle spasms, confusion etc) but to have anxiety increase into a barely staved off panic attacks at least once a day really freaking sucks. I'm also working on a lot of exposure therapy and CBT and that's definitely poked a already very mad very scared bear.  
I read that this can happen and for many it was like a switch at some point in the month to six week mark that their anxiety when markedly down and they were doing much better. But right now, I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I won't quit, but I'm more angry, sad and scared than I've been in a long time. I hope you guys can share some insight on your experiences, especially those with very similar symptoms and mental disorder flavors like mine.  


I also recently read that you need to either eat, or not eat while taking the meds and stick to it. Unfortunately I switched this up because I noticed I felt much worse if I don't eat at the time of dosage. I really hope that I haven't ""reset"" my bodies process of getting used to it by starting to eat when I take my dosage.  


Anyway, hope you guys are having a good day. Anxiety absolutely sucks like nothing I've known before.",Anyone taking or has taken busperione? This drug is kicking my ass :/,Anxiety,1,c7pwil,False

I tried to calm down myself but I texted my mom and woke her up. I went to go sit with her but the fear skyrocketed. I couldn't stay in her room which felt tiny and closing in. I started crying and panicking so I went to be on my own. I was able to somewhat calm down but still feel really shaky and scared. 

I don't want to have to wake her again to take me to an emergency but I'm also terrified that I really hurt my head. I feel awful and just want to cry more. To make things worse I have to work tomorrow and it's a holiday so they for some reason will have not many people staffed.

I've generally been a decent student throughout med school, studious, decent scores, never cheated, got through viva-voces quite without any hiccups. But the only thing that has bothered me the most was speaking out in public!
I've always been thoroughly terrified to give speeches/presentations in med school (but somehow managed it), but no matter how many times I try to overcome my stage fright and the anxiety, it just doesn't happen!

It's petrifying when I go out on the stage and my hands start trembling and I mess up the words and my mind completely  blanks out sometimes.

t2_2ebhqqkr,"Hi guys,

For the last few years, I have suffered with pretty bad anxiety. All of my anxious and obtrusive thoughts seem to be internally focused, I panic about losing control, losing my mind, losing touch with reality, becoming terminally ill, having a heart attack, dying, to name a few. None of the above has happened to me before.

I constantly worry about something bad will happen to me. This leads often to panic attacks, which usually include some pretty bad heart palpitations and a lot of nausea.

I also have pretty depressive thoughts, not thinking I'm good enough for anything, I deal with big insecurity issues and figuring it is better off if I am no longer alive. 

I have been taking many approaches to help with this, such as therapy and also some self care methods but nothing seems to be effective. My partner suggested that the next step is that I need to take medication.

I have never taken medication before for mental health issues. My GP has prescribed Setraline. 50MG, but for the first two weeks, starting with 25MG.

I have not yet taken it as I am absolutely terrified to do so. I feel taking medication is going to make me lose control, and my depressive and anxious thoughts will only get more intense, or else I could be subject to hallucinations or something that is going to make me lose touch with reality. 

I hyperventilate at the thought of taking the medication because I am just so anxious of what could happen. I find I just obsess too much with the side effects, no matter how uncommon they are. I don't know how the hell I can bring myself to take them.

Though staying feeling like this, the depressive thoughts and anxiety that is really ruining the quality of my life cannot continue.

Yesterday I went on a 30 min drive with my wife and kid out to a great hiking location we've enjoyed for years. I have anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and driving can often trigger those. On this drive I was not doing well. But holding it together. Usually upon arrival my mind and body relax quite a bit and I'm more free to enjoy the moment, but this time, for whatever reason, the struggle was much harder. 

The park is quite large and has winding roads throughout, and my kid began to meander into the road without looking, so in my parent voice I barked at him to watch both sides etc.

This is the part where the problem kicked in. My wife (13 yrs married) barked back at me, ""You need to change your attitude, god you're annoying,"" which just ended me. We had a long hike ahead of us, and I tried to keep up, but for the most part I was lagging slowly behind as I felt like retching, and also doing my best to maintain a mindful meditation. She never came back to help ease the distress. That was weird.

It is now a day later, and while she apologized today, she doesn't express much beyond that she just ""let it slip,"" or sentiments along those lines. Again, we're 13 years in so I'm starting to wonder for just how long and how much my condition has been burdening her patience in this way (especially as I know from personal experience, that can end a relationship). She maintains that I can be frustrating and can't promise that this won't happen again.

Additionally she is already on anxiety relieving pills, but these are only taken when necessary and not relied on.

Whether or not this is about the breakup or another topic in general is a mystery to me. I’m going for the later though as we’ve never had trouble talking about her breakup.

I’m 19 now and it’s persisting alright. 

Although I’ve also been a little nervous to be tested because if it wasn’t arthritis that meant I was crazy and it was my anxiety manifesting as physical pain.. but I got the courage and did it.

I called to ask about the results and one of the nurses told me I had osteoarthritis in my left hand, which is my less dominant hand so I assumed it was in both cause that’s how arthritis works, it likes to be symmetrical in your body usually although since I write (everything i do involves my hands, painting, writing, art) i understood my right hand would be noticeably worse and maybe that’s why they didn’t mention it at first. Although it’s a big deal for me to have this, it will affect my entire life because of how much I rely on being able to write. 

So I got the call from my doctor back and he said that I do not have any arthritis in either of my hands... wtf

So I’ve been kinda sitting on this panicking about the idea that my anxiety holds me back this much and there’s nothing I can do about it but slowly the pains been getting worse and worse and worse.

t2_xq2zi,"Hi everyone,

I haven't posted here before, but I could use a little advice or just encouragement after something that happened to me last night.

My boyfriend and I went to bed around 10pm and at 11:30pm our building's fire alarm went off. It is SO loud, maybe one of the loudest alarms I have ever heard. I don't to extremely well with loud noises, especially if they are unexpected.

I woke up screaming (not shrieking or anything, more like a loud ""ahhh"") and my boyfriend wanted to calm me, so he kind of slid on top of me and said ""the fire alarm is going off, we need to get out of the building"" as I kept screaming. At the time, I actually didn't realize I was screaming, which is why I was so alarmed that my boyfriend jumped on top of me and told me what was going on - because, yeah if you hear the fire alarm go off, that is what you do. I told my boyfriend later I was confused why he reacted that way and he told me he was trying to calm me because I was screaming.

Anyway, he helped me get out of bed and put a robe on. In less than 30 seconds we were outside and away from the building. We figured since we couldn't see or smell any smoke or fire, it was probably just set off by someone burning food or something. We stood outside for 10-15 minutes, and were able to go back inside.

I had a lot of trouble falling asleep last night. I'm usually a good sleeper, unless I am feeling anxious, then my brain tends to either want me to deeply analyze something random (for example: listing everything we have in the fridge over and over) or repeating the same thoughts over and over. Today, I have been shaking all morning and feeling extremely uneasy.

As someone who has suffered from anxiety much of my life, I know it can often be illogical, but still I feel silly being so shaken up from a simple fire alarm. I think it was just the first 10 seconds of being awoken suddenly by the alarm, my own screaming reaction, and my boyfriend's reaction to my screaming. It was a very unexpectedly traumatic and I don't know what to do about it right at this moment.

Has anyone experienced something like this?

t2_3wdstd91,"1. *Stop stimulating the mind all the time!*

This is the most helpful tip I could possibly give to anyone struggling with anxiety. If you over stimulate your mind with games, television shows, movies, etc., you will for sure develop an over imaginative mind that doesn't take any instruction from you.


2. *If you are a highly inactive person then start consuming less food (very low!)*

Don't stuff your body with food constantly. That way you don't over burden your digestive system and cause lethargy to the body. The place where the digestive system is located is also the centre of anxiety. Any moment in the past where you experienced fear, it originated from the pit of the stomach. So loosen your stomach by deep belly breathing and consuming less food.


3. *Don't consume meat*

I could care less about the morality of eating meat but physiologically, eating meat is bad for your body. All herbivores have teeth that can cut and grind whereas carnivores can only perform cutting action. Also the length human alimentary canal is similar to herbivores than carnivores. This is because our body expects that the food we eat should be digested within a few hours. It takes enormous amount of energy for our digestive system to digest meat. Meat will take about 48 to 52 hours to pass through our system by which time it begins to rot in the digestive system producing excessive bacterial activity. Whereas if you consume fruits for instance, it will take about 3 hours to pass through the system and not much energy is expended digesting it.


4. *Do Yoga*

Yoga is not a flexibility exercise that one does every Sunday to help with backaches. The word yoga means union - uniting oneself with everything else around. Hatha Yoga aims at bringing balance to the body before bringing balance to the mind. It is difficult to control the mind with the mind. It will act crazy even after years of serious meditation. Yoga understands this problem and hence proposes to tame the grosser parts of the mind (the physical body) before proceeding to tame the mind. In India, serious disciples of yoga will practice Hatha yoga for 36 years before they move on to Dhyana or meditation. So if you are looking forward to take up any new practice for inner work, my suggestion would be to take up Yoga.",Few tips I would like to share that have helped me immensely to curb my anxiety.,Anxiety,0,c7tuhf,False

So after a couple weeks and reading a lot online I decided to try smoking a bit. I got an indica that people recommended, and at first it was very intense, but ended up being like a ""mind opening"" positive experience that I would end up meditating and relaxing to. Last week though I had a very bad panic attack on the way to work (driving is my biggest problem, usually highways and being ""stuck"" at lights/trains/traffic) I ended up having to pull over in a neighborhood because I felt tingly and numb and like I was having a heart attack. Why do panic attacks always have to start in my left arm?

I had an event coming up at work that was requiring a drive on the highway, and even though I had drove to the city a few weeks ago, after taking  a klonopin as needed, I was already setting myself up for failure on this drive.

That night I drove home and I had more panic, but not as bad, and I decided to take a half day and drive to the event from home, avoiding the highway completely, bad I know. After this stressful few days I tried smoking my indica at night and was fine at first, but ended up getting the ""weed shakes"" real bad when trying to sleep, which is basically like a very bad panic attack, and they both compound each other. My whole body was shaking and twitching, teeth chattering, chest and heart felt extremely fluttery and like they were popping out and beating all messed up. I put on some warm clothes and played a game and it subsided, but my chest still hurt. It's now 3 days later and I still have this spot of tightness and like something is blocked in my left side of my chest. I feel some pressure, lack of strength, and lifting, clenching fist seems to make it worse. When I take a very deep breath it almost feels like there's an air bubble or something in there.

t2_3in38wad,"
It’s been 3 years since I’ve developed this. It all started one day at uni. Luckily I remember when and why it all started. Well I blushed in front of a friend (I didn’t even notice it) and he pointed at me saying “haha you turned bright red!” Since then I developed a phobia of blushing, and to this day, I feel extreme anxiety (I want to escape the social situation, I feel like I’m so uncomfortable and my face starts tingling) the overall sensation I feel is: extreme embarrassment. What I feel inside is 1000x worse than what people see on the outside. I might appear calm but I feel like shit on the inside. I don’t know how to explain the feeling I get, but it’s all about being uncomfortable on my skin, feeling hot and accelerated (super anxious) and it makes me want to interact with NO ONE because of this sensation.

So, I need your help on this: some stuff has happened but I want to focus on what’s happening right now. I started the gym. And I’m doing it for my overall wellness, physical and mental health. The thing is... the first day of course the fear began to appear “what if I turn red? The professor will think I’m attracted to him” and guess what happened: I turned so red, that I felt like my face was about to explode and the professor told me to lay down on the floor, because he thought my pressure was down (of course he doesn’t know it’s all about the phobia) I swear guys I’ve never felt so much heat on my face. For some reason, when I’m working out, and my heart is racing and I’m hot, it’s easier for the phobia to appear and the red face to make its appearance, why is that? Is it normal? I feel like all of my senses are accelerated and I feel so self conscious about myself, I don’t know how to explain it...

Today I went to the gym again, and this time there was another boy as a professor, and luckily I didn’t go all the way red like last time, but I did feel so uncomfortable on the inside when interacting with him. And on top of all, he stares right at me in the eyes and it makes me so uncomfortable! It didn’t happen to me before I developed this phobia. It’s like my mind is aware at every single situation like it’s under a threat, waiting for something to happen to make my face go red! It makes every situation super stressful because it’s like I’m waiting for something to happen, it’s like my mind acts paranoid in this situations. It’s really stressful for me.

I swear to you guys, this is ruining my life, I wasn’t like this a few years back. I feel like I have no control over this, that I may lose my mind. It’s so frustrating.

What if I look ridiculous? I will stress over perfecting every detail from my hair to my posture to my voice to my facial expressions. It goes on and on and is utterly exhausting.

I'm 21 years old, living in the UK, and I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember. I've been on a cocktail of anti-depressants and been through numerous therapies for most of my adult life. My anxiety coupled with depression has resulted in me isolating myself from society and losing friends, family, and a long time girlfriend. Earlier this year I decided to drastically alter my lifestyle as I was very close to killing myself. I joined a local Muay Thai gym and used most of my free time from not working to engage in physical pursuits. I have reduced the amount of medication I am on, stopped drinking, and lost 50 lbs. I feel a lot better physically however the anxiety which was my main issue has never really gone away. I am moving away very soon to live with my cousin on the other end of the country. I am doing this in an attempt to thrust myself into living a 'normal' life.

Due totally to circumstances I SHOULD be able to control, I'm very behind on a few projects at work and it's starting to get called out. The timing is awful. I woke up at 4AM-- 3 hours before I need to leave for my flight sick to my stomach over this, so here I am. Trying to work. Trying to push through the things giving me this sickening feeling. Or should I say the things I did to get to this point.

I have the unfortunate, and probably very common, combination of ADD and anxiety. My work style is knock a few things out, get a false sense of hope it's under control. Get sucked down a rabbit hole of starting too many other things at ones and panicking about what to do now. Is this right? Am I late? Is this bad? Will someone find out I'm a fraud?  Now I am late. It is bad. How do I mitigate this ?

Trying some slow breathing now. Drinking some tea. Opening my next assignment. ONE assignment. What can I accomplish in the next two hours before I need to make sure I'm ready to travel (of course that's anxiety inducing in itself). 

I'm finally at a point where I'm actively trying to work on managing my ADD and anxiety for what they are, as I never had the support or awareness before. I don't know which to tackle first. Is one a byproduct of the other? Which direction?

t2_2vux51og,"Okay there's some backstory to this and I'm in the midst of an anxiety attack, which tends to make me rambly so please bear with me 

TL;DR: scheduled for work after an issue with the planning app, I'm not in the country so can't work. This isn't the first time this happened so I feel extremely anxious and guilty about it.

The company I work for does their planning through their website or app. You fill in your availability a month early (so August availability has to be put in before July 5th) and they'll schedule you accordingly. There's no set amount of hours you'll work and you could get an email the day before that they scheduled you. This already doesn't work too well with my anxiety, bc I don't like the work and I need some time to adjust to the idea of it, but so far I've been able to cope. The only reason I haven't quit yet is bc they gave me a three day course to make sure I was able to do the basics of health care and if I quit before a specific amount of shifts, I have to pay back the cost of that. That's €900 I don't have. Discounts are available at other amounts of shifts and that's what I'm working towards.

HOWEVER. I've had several issues with the app/website. I've been scheduled when I had changed my availability but it apparently didn't come through, so I had to email them saying that I wasn't actually available on the planned shift. This has happened two times since I came to the company in February. 

Last month, I got a text from the planner saying that it was the 3rd and I needed to plan my availability. Having genuinely forgotten, I did so immediately. The next day I got another text that I really needed to file it or my regional manager would be in touch. I checked, my hours were in my app, so I guessed maybe it needed some time to adjust. For a week, I heard nothing. After that week, however, I got an irritated text that I STILL had not filed availability. Confused I texted back that I had in fact filed it, and it showed so in my app, but I told them I'd check on my laptop. But honestly, all my hours were there. To make sure, I filed everything again, and texted that to the planner. 

The next day I got a call from my regional manager. I was at school so it was a voicemail, but it basically told me I really needed to fucking file my availability or there would be consequences. I heard the voicemail after office hours, so I decided to call back the next day (help), but the next day was Saturday so my regional manager was not available. The dude I had on the phone told me my availability seemed fine, so it was left at that. 

Besides that, I've had a time where I forgot to chance availability and got scheduled. Emailed saying that and the planner was (understandably) annoyed, but changed it. All of this together makes me super anxious when it comes to the planning and contacting the planner, because it keeps happening and I feel like they might think it's an excuse and I just regularly freak out about the whole thing. 

So now for the current issue at hand: last week something in my personal plans changed and I suddenly had an opening to go on vacation. I booked the plane tickets and made SURE to change my availability at work. I did this on Tuesday and checked yesterday and everything seemed fine. I fly next Wednesday and I'm looking forward to it. Until I receive an email this morning that they scheduled me for Thursday. I'm out of the country on Thursday. I immediately freak out and send them an email telling about previous trouble with the app and that I changed my availability, but things went wrong and I am in fact NOT available that Thursday. I feel sick with anxiety and guilt over this, because I feel like this happens far too often for the few times I have worked since I was employed. 

I also reached out to my regional manager about this, explained the issues but also my feelings of stress and guilt about this, and that I wanted to quit as SOON as I hit the first discount goal. This will be end of August. I can't continue working for this company anymore, everytime I'm scheduled I start having anxiety attacks day in advance and this whole thing just tipped me over the edge.

I'm currently going back to college about 2 hours away from my hometown, it will be my second year. I had a difficult first year, and had a lot of trouble making friends. I made some friends in my residence in my second semester, and ended up dating someone in that friend group. I broke up with them over the summer, as I had a lot of time to reflect, and I started to believe that I wasn't attracted to them and only dated them to avoid awkwardness in the friend group, and to keep those friends. When I broke up with them, my ex was really sad/angry about it. I'm not sure that we are on good terms.

Going back to college has me really nervous, as I'm not sure if I'm going to have friends to hang out with. I get along well with some of them individually, but I am getting major anxiety about going to events that my ex is also invited to. Without that group, I'm afraid I won't have any friends aside from my roommate. Last year I was too afraid to join any clubs, and I worry the same thing is going to happen this year.

t2_4hsuugok,"Hi,

This has been the worst year of my life. Anxiety and depression were very unfamiliar to me until some time last year. In my mid they couldn't just come on their own. There had a clear reason for them. I guess i was wrong. Going from doing quite well in school, with friends and life in general to finishing school with horrible grades and avoiding all social contact like the plague. Anxiety has caused me so much trouble I don't even know where to begin. 

I cant go anywhere without worrying myself sick thinking about everything that could go wrong. Will i embarrass myself? Will I be in an accident? Will i unknowingly piss someone off? Before leaving the house I have probably went through every single possible catastrophic scenario I can think of. It does not matter if I'm just walking ten minutes to the store and back, my anxiety is always there to ruin it. Can't see my friends without constantly wanting to go home as soon as possible without being rude.

My parents are semi-understanding. I go to a therapist once a week which they support but they don't really believe anxiety is as difficult to deal with as it can be. They mean well although they got more of a ""it can't be that bad, just ignore it"" attitude. I have learned that it's easier to say no to things that trigger anxiety to avoid it altogether instead of actually facing it. Although this works short-term it causes even more anxiety because if you're avoiding everything, how are you supposed to accomplish anything? I cannot remember the last time i did something i was really proud of. Feel like a burden to my family and friends, I don't contribute with anything.

University starts in a couple of days and I'm terrified. Terrified that my anxiety will get the upper hand and that i will be back at home feeling sorry for myself. I don't even know how many hours i have spent worrying about group projects and if i will be ""good"" enough.  My parents has set up a plan for my future but if nothing changes, there's no way I'm going to manage. I don't have a plan myself for the future nor does the future excite me very much. Feels like I'm stuck, going nowhere but maybe university will change that? If not i don't know what to do. Have not seen much improvement since i got help.

t2_c6leako,"Hey all. I'm married to a wonderful woman who happens to suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. It's been a long road getting for her properly diagnosed, and I've got such respect for the battles she fights daily in her head, out of sight, but no less brutal and exhausting. This is NOT a vent post. My wife is a warrior fighting a ruthless enemy that knows all her weaknesses, and way more often than not she wins.

When her anxiety is bad, or she's having a panic attack, she can get very defensive, and will sometimes lash out and say some pretty nasty things to me in the heat of the moment. This isn't a regular occurance, but it happens sometimes. It can be tough for me because in the moment she sounds like she means what she says, even if I know she really doesn't and it's her anxiety talking. 

My question revolves around the fact that she often has no memory of having said these things once she's back to herself again. I remember them, but she doesn't. It creates a rough situation, because I hear what she says and it affects me, but she's devastated if I tell her what she's done and she feels awful for days.  For those reasons it can be hard for us to have a constructive conversation about it after the fact. 

So, folks with anxiety, if you could help an ally out, I'd like to understand what's going on a little better. Have you experienced something similar? Have you said or done things you didn't remember after? Can you give me any insight from the point of view of the person with anxiety?

t2_4b22vfg2,"I have multiple friends with anxiety (two with GAD, one with hypochondria, one with social anxiety and one with panic disorder), so I generally know how to help people with anxiety in different situations. If they need it, I let them be, help them breath, talk the trigger out or try to defeat the trigger. But the thing is, I only helped with triggers outside of me. Now, one of my friend is anxious of our friendship and I don't know what should I do.

Now, I know that I am not a therapist, and I don't want to ""fix"" her problem, nor do I think that I should help every anxious friend every time. But I also think that since ""I am"" the trigger, it does matter how I behave in this situation. 

The backstory: me and this friend lived together for 1,5 years in a dorm, as roommates. But it got the the point, where we started to argue a lot. Not serious things, we can always resolve them, that is not the problem. The problem is that we hung around each other a lot, since we go to the same university also, have most of our classes together. And I suggested that we change roommates (since we cant change our courses), so we don't spend every day together, because that may help the situation. If we only spend half a day together, we can cool down a bit because we would have our own space. I was happy to change roommates, because I think it is a really great opportunity to learn more about living together with others, and but she only ever lived with me in a dorm, has way less experience in a dorm, so she is really anxious. I told her after 1-2 month she would get used to the new people.

But recently she told me she is way more anxious about me, because she thinks that I don't need her as much as she needs me, and I don't like her company as much as she likes mine, and I like the new people more than her. I KNOW that it's her anxiety speaking and she is really not that self-centered. But I don't know how to react. Because I think it would reassure her if we spend a lit of time together during the first months, so she knows I value our friendship, but also I want to give each other more space, since that is why we decided to move into separate rooms. We would see each other at school every day, so we would meet up, but I think she needs way more quality time together than me, and that is not because I don't like her, but because I enjoy my hobbies alone a lot. And I also want both of us to get to know our new roommates. I really think she is taking this as a rejection because of her anxiety.

Do you have any suggestions? How do I reassure her? It is really a bad situation, because I feel like I am in control, and she is not. I forced her to move rooms, she didn't want to. I don't want to meet that often, she would like to. My desires will be met, but hers won't, and I don't like this position.

but today is my birthday. and i really wanted to be happy and not think of anything. is been really stressful for me for the past few months. yesterday i planned that today, im just gonna chill and not think. and i had some stuff to do yesterday and didnt feel like it but i force myself to do it so i would feel accomplished and not think about it today. 

and everything was quite alright in the morning. but my brain just had to turn the happy peacefulness off and just attack me. all of sudden i was just looking at my phone eager for getting wishes. and feel so ashamed to even think of this.  i really do! but i cant help but think of this. no one wished but one person (a family member just felt like out of courtesy) . the rest no. i always wish me friends and family on their bday and holidays but i didnt get any. i know that they are busy and im trying to tell myself that and not be a little b\*tch. but i just feel  i put too much effort for others and i care too much about others sometimes more than for my family. i dont have anyone that i can call my close friend. i dont. i would try my best to wish them early as midnight and feel bad if i didnt wish them soon. i think im just stupid. im always there for them but when is something for me (anything) no one is there really. i feel that i have ""friends' but i dont think they acknowledge me as close unless they need something then im very close to them but when they are done, im nothing

but i tried to push this aside and continued with my dad then all of sudden my parent told me that something was happening today (not related to my bday), and they knew about it from yesterday but no one told me eventhough i live in the same house. only knew it 10 minutes before. there were some relatives who came to this thing (they have no idea is my bday and i dont care if they didnt know cause im not close with them). but they brought up some stuffs, stuffs that im stressed about and didnt want to think today. my family are not the nicest... they definitely shaped me who i am today (they helped me hate myself alot, they said lot of not nice things). i try to avoid them (the whole clan) but sometimes i cant and today was the day. now they know my number (which i dont give to any family unless is my parents and siblings) cause im just avoiding them. but i just feel so mad that i didnt know they were coming over. i never got told anything. 

i just exploded, i told my parent that im mad about this. why didnt i get a heads up. why do i not know anything. this is not the only time, there were amny things they didnt tell me. everyone else knew but me. i was really looking forward to just one day being just happy. like my parent told me that they didnt want them to come over but it just happen. 

i just hate everything. i hate that im too nice and a pushover and fucking hate that i smile a lot (a mechanism when someone is telling stuff that are not nice or i dont want to hear). this is not my year. i feel like a F. a loser. i am definitely am. i just feel a mess just like this post. im sorry if this just waster your time. i really want to run away. i was so happy when i was away for college cause i didnt have to see family and i want that again. ppl say that im weird that im living alone  (when i was a way for college) or dont mingle with my family (cause i dont want to cause they aint nice). they think is bad to be alone. but i love alone, of course alone with freedome. right now im alone (eventhough i live with family) but i got not freedom (yet, looking for jobs which is one of my stress).

t2_3k5d7k3z,"Hello, I'm not sure if this will fit here but I'm at my wits end and not sure where to turn. Sorry if this is a mess, I'm writing this through tears,

Im saving up for counselling but it will be a while before I can afford it.

A few months ago I went through drug withdrawal and with that came a slew of nasty symptoms. It was hell.  It heightened my anxiety and it doesn't seem to have gone back down. There was a few weeks where I had horrible insomnia as well. During the insomnia, I set myself a strict bedtime of 10pm, so that way I'd have a lot of time to try and squeeze some hours out of the night.

All the symptoms have come to pass, but Im left with some issues still - namely anxiety about sleep. 

I have gotten to a point where I can sleep for a solid 8 hours but only if I go to bed at or before 9:30-10pm. If I stay up later than this, my body starts to go into panic mode, thinking that I wont sleep, I don't have enough hours to sleep, and that I'm screwed for the next day until 9:30 when I can try to sleep again.

I start to feel very tired/groggy around 9 but if I stay up that feeling goes away? I've tried pushing my limits but I end up having a hard time falling asleep and it's very fragmented and short (4 hours).

I know I don't have any diagnosed sleeping problems, when I am able to get into bed at my proffered times everything goes fine.

But I feel like I've lost the ability to stay up? Or have any fluidity in my sleep schedule. This scares me because it fits my current lifestyle now but what if I have to change it? (I know in life I'll have to stay awake and sleep at weird times sometimes). I miss being able to stay awake and go out with friends, but since all this happened I haven't done anything fun after 8pm to ensure I am home and able to be in bed.

I never ever had a problem with this before, sleep was something I just did and never thought twice about, but now it's on my mind constantly. I watch the time like a hawk and as I see the numbers tick past the more nervous I get.

t2_4gvua27q,"I've had this problem for a long time and it's frustrating. Can anyone relate. I am sure it has its roots deep in social anxiety.

Honestly, I wear pretty sloppy clothes to work and I'm not very happy with my hairstyle either, but I am too afraid to change it. This deeply affects my confidence as I feel like a slob yet I don't want to draw attention to myself by wearing a different style of clothes, I often hide out in my office where I won't be seen. It has even gotten to the point where I wear jackets/fleece/pullovers over my everyday clothes because I hate my current wardrobe and making an excuse like ""I'm cold"", yet I gain some sort of comfort by covering up how ""bad"" I look. 

I am OK with how my body looks and I think I'm a fairly attractive person so it's not that. I guess I'm just afraid of drawing attention to myself or having people think ""Oh she's dressing differently"" or ""She has all new clothes now and a different style"" even though I doubt anyone would give a shit to think any of that. 

I looked online and found a lot of outfits I would love to wear. A chambray shirt, an olive cardigan. Black jeans! All stuff I would feel very good and even sexy/confident wearing out in public like to Target or the movies. All stuff that would look put together and classy at work, too. If I ran into a coworker there, I wouldn't care. But for some damn reason if I imagine wearing these clothes to the office I panic and I can't and I end up going back to my old sloppy wardrobe. 

Has anyone experienced these feelings before? How do I get over it? I'm thinking of wearing one article of new clothing to work every day to kind of ease into it, but a lot of ""new"" things I wear only look good when I wear the entire ensemble. I feel a bit shallow making such a huge deal out of clothing but this issue has really affected my self confidence. 

I was promoted recently and start a brand new job next week (well, internal transfer to a new office and everything) and I want to start off on a fresh new foot and being more confident and free to wear what I want, because I feel like if I don't start wearing what I like now, I never will.",Afraid to wear new clothes or a new hairstyle around people I know (esp. at work).,Anxiety,21,cybms7,False

t2_35asc889,"23F, here. This post is really long, I'm sorry. TW for mention of suicide. 

My whole life I have had debilitating anxiety and depression. I almost didn't graduate high school, and was told to stay away from college because of my inability to handle a lot at once. I thought I'd try it anyways, as I believed in myself at the time. I have almost graduated, with this fifth year being my last. I can only handle about 12 credits each semester (you need 16 about every semester to graduate in four years), I have been beating myself up about the fifth year but I am pretty proud of myself that I am at the home stretch. I spend about two hours getting up, trying to call myself down for the day, It's a struggle every single morning, that I have to converse with people, that I have to have trust in myself, and usually I can overcome it. Going to classes is a lot for me to handle. When I come home, I am very exhausted, and playing video games and shutting myself in my room helps me heal, which I think is more because I am an introvert. I don't have many friends because I don't go to parties or any social gatherings, and I am okay with that. This is embarrassing to say, but I've never worked a job. School has been already enough for me to handle and I can't add anything more on to my life, unless I need to. Once school ends, I will look for jobs. My ""job"" right now is doing art commissions, which has helped me some. 

Despite of everything I struggle with, I have been able to maintain As and Bs in my classes. I should be proud of myself and I try to be. In high school I would have never dreamed of this. 

Recently in the past seven months I have been in a bad depression, because of my anxiety. I've considered suicide many times. I get so many panic attacks about the next day that I want to end myself do I don't have to handle the next day. 

I told my roommate I was very depressed. She proceeded to tell me that she also has had depression and anxiety and she understands what it's like, which helped me. But then she started giving me this pep talk. She thinks that I'm not using ""my full potential"" and doing more things will help my anxiety and depression. She says that ""you need to push yourself to do things that will give you responsibility and higher self-esteem"" and that ""you need to get a job because you are avoiding it and it will hurt you later in life"". She says that I lock myself in my room and I'm not helping myself. That I'm not going out there and ""doing successful things"". 

Is she correct? She is an amazing person and I trust what she says, but if it's true, I don't think I can live with myself. I am trying so hard right now. I can't believe I'm not pushing myself.

I'm vegetarian and my dad and brother like to make fun of vegan items/people who don't eat meat, so I haven't told them I'm vegetarian even though I've (happily) been for 6 months.

t2_177v57nx,"I know how hard it can be to get out of bed. When the anxiety keeps you up at night, and by the time you fall asleep it's already time to get up for the day soon. So you start the day with a panic attack. Or crying. Or thinking you can't do it. And all the better and easier choice would be to stay in bed and deal with your anxiety away from the pressures of life.

But sometimes life hands us these deals, so that we can prove to ourselves how damn resilient we are! You got up today. You're reading this post. To me, that signifies you've already got that strength in you. Keep pushing and keep fighting it.

For me, anxiety is the constant battle in my head. I know what I think is irrational, and most likely is not going to happen in that terrible outcome. My brain and my heart know this. But that anxiety creeps up and shuts it down. Builds pressure up into my chest till I can't breathe. Tells me it will be that bad. That it'll definitely turn out crappy.

But over the years, I've have tried to remind myself, since when has attempting to think positively ever harmed anything? Try to think of all the times when your anxiety got to you. You assume the day is going to start bad. Then of course you'll see every little tiny thing that happens as something negative or that the world is out to get you. But it really isn't. Even when I struggle to come up with a positive thought, I'll try to think of something completely random and strange, so that my train of thought doesn't spiral down the negativity rabbit hole. So maybe that will work for you! 

And remember, we all know how lonely it can feel. That no one understands you. But I promise you there are others struggling the same as you and we have the strength &amp; power to battle through it. Remember that even where you feel you don't have support or it isn't received in the way you want, that those offering support are doing so in the ways that they know how to comfort. Even when I think my friends aren't worrying about me or they don't contact me after a few days, sometimes people just don't know you are struggling unless you let them know. And I know it's hard to open up. But I've found people are a lot more receptive than you'd make them out to be..

Either way, I want you to know that you are doing you're absolute best, the universe sees all you are doing, and I promise good blessings are coming your way. In the dark, it's hard to see them. But I can feel it today. Today is your new start, new month, new you, your day to send that text, make that call, tell that person you love them, hug your friends and family, go after that job you want, pick up that dusty book you've been meaning to read, take a nice walk and get fresh air. There's so many small blessings and light in every day life that we miss during our struggles.

And this is a reminder that you are all that light. I see how every one of you loves, supports and respects everyone in your life and this community.

Some days, I will love PC gaming. I will get into skyrim, or assassin's creed, or the batman trilogy, and play for a while. I would love it. Just as I used to as a kid without a care in the world.

Other days, I wish to write it off as a hobby.

I can never relax when I game, and at the end of the gaming sessions I always either delete my saved game to deter me from playing again, or

I am unable to game until boredom and then call it a day, and say to myself 'well, I'll play sometime tomorrow or something'.

**-Time which can be spent doing more productive things.** I know nobody is ALWAYS working or doing productive stuff, but videogames as a leisure is one of the lesser things you can do, regarding learning something new. Guitar for example, is a great skill which I am trying to get into a habit of playing often. Exercise is also beneficial. Reading non-fiction books or watching informative TV documentaries can also equip one with fresh knowledge.

**-The real world.** Videogames are virtual worlds, and I like to get sunk into games like RDR2 and really immerse myself into the experience. But, in reality, I have no friends, no reason to get out of bed in the morning, nothing.

If I went cold turkey, sold my PS4, uninstalled steam, and tried for a week- maybe it will be the best thing I can do in my position to decrease my stress. But I would be missing out on so much would-be entertainment, if I didn't worry so much.

t2_c5a7rpc,"*TL;DR: I’m trying to fix posture, but that requires being aware of my body. Being aware of my body triggers my subconscious body anxiety, and I’m having massive tension problems because of it. How can I do one but avoid the other?*

Here’s the gist of it:

-	I’m trying to fix forward head posture and rolled shoulders
-	I’ve been having horrible every day tension in my shoulders and upper back. It happens for weeks sometimes, or sometimes just a day or two. It leads to headaches, sometimes migraines.
-	I have bad body/health anxiety

There’s tons of variables to consider, but I think the pain problem is caused by my anxiety. Here’s why:

-	Sometimes the tension will go away for a long periods (weeks, even) despite me doing the exact same things.
-	I have a bad habit of obsessing over my body when I’m trying to fix something (fixing posture every five seconds, forcing movements, getting frustrated, etc.). This is partly my ADHD, I’m guessing. 
-	I am incapable of relaxing when this happens. I sit on the couch and instantly feel tension and cannot let myself “sink into the couch” no matter what. Same with chairs, sometimes standing.
-	If I get frustrated or depressed and give up, the tension often goes away while I mope around and zone out/lie down. 
-	It’s near-impossible to stop once it starts. I think this is me looping into myself (anxiety causes tension, tension causes anxiety, etc.). It does, however, go away sometimes when I’m very stimulated/distracted. 
-	I feel like the tension basically ruins my life when it happens, especially since I immediately anticipate it swelling/the headache, and it kills entire day’s easily.
-	My physiotherapist and masseuse don’t seem to understand what I’m talking about it when I tell them how fast the tension kicks in when I try to sit or the like. They just tell me to keep working on posture and to “try and move positions often” (but it happens with seconds sometimes).
-	When I meditated today, and the app told me to feel the gravity pulling me, the tension melted away (at least temporarily). 
-	Even when I play a game or watch a show, it feels like half my mind is gripping my body. 

So. I’m pretty sure it’s anxiety.

How the hell do I fix my posture, though, if I have this anxiety? It’s so damn subconscious—even if I’m trying to actively “relax” it doesn’t work. So far only meditation has done that successfully, or when I think I’ve found a “solution” (rolling shoulders back, for example).

If I’m trying to fix posture, I have to think of my body. If I think of my body, I get tense.

I sprinted to the toilets,but near them I had a pooping sensation. I was in a shock and ran to the nearest toilet. Thankfully I have not pooped my leggings,but I had some kind of diarrhea. I pooped and went to class that day.

Now every day I have that pooping sensation in classes ( I have the worst toilet anxiety when I am in a class with a strict teacher,which I am kind of afraid) I was also afraid my classmates and my teachers would laugh at me.

Because I didn’t want to rely on medication forever, I stopped taking the pills I was on from about July to February of this year and now I’m a shell of what I used to be due to the trauma that I’ve put myself through from all the panic attacks I’ve experienced since stopping.

t2_g13n6w9,"It all started three months ago. Or to more accurately put it; got worse three months ago. I've always been the anxious personality. In my early to mid teens I had pretty aggressive social anxiety which I have little to no amount of right now. I consider myself pretty social and to be honest with you, I kinda hate being alone. Opposite to my early teens where I never wanted to leave the house or converse with others because of said SA.

This is all pretty much besides the point, my anxiety devolved into almost a hypochondriac/ocd type. Right now I fear that I am slowly losing my mind, like I'm developing schizophrenia. Let me give you more detail.

Three months ago I dropped acid for my first time. I was never a big drug user having only smoked weed a quite low amount of times. Acid is something that was always on my bucket list, and my long time friend just happened to be dealing so I kinda just jumped on the occasion. (The LSD was tested and real.) My trip was pretty alright, I had a mini panic attack towards the end thinking I would never come down and that I was stuck in that state forever. 

I had anxiety pretty bad the weeks after. My eyes weren't playing tricks on me or anything just total fear of developing HPPD or never returning to being a normal person. Thinking back on it I felt pretty normal about a month after. Until I decided, stupidly, to smoke weed again. 

I had a panic attack that wasn't too obvious to my friends, but my mind was running in circles, I don't remember what I was thinking exactly just that I was fucking scared wholeheartedly that I'd never be normal again. I'd never return to being me again.

I had a pretty rough day after. Having only slept four hours on my friends couch and needing to go to work a couple hours later. Only now something changed. I drove to work and I would periodically have my mind play tricks on me. I thought I had finally done it. Break my connection to reality. Break my sanity. Ironically I did get it off my mind during the day at work but once I started driving back home I started noticing it again!

Driving used to be my therapy. Where I can listen to music and drive down the pretty streets of my hometown and enjoy the scenery, now devolved into ""Am I about to get a trashcan confused with a person walking down a street again?""

The anxiety has gotten so bad lately I even have started to question every sound I hear. I'd hear a plane fly overhead and ask myself if I am just hearing stuff. Only to take my headset off and hear it and confirm that, of course, it was real. I even mentioned it to my sister just to be absolutely sure. 

""Did you hear that plane fly by? It was loud as hell, huh?""

""Yeah it sounds like they're flying really low!""

Some nights I'd get so scared of losing control and genuinely believing that one morning I will be waking up a full blown schizo.

This week has been especially hard for me because I thought for a couple days that my crazy aunt had schizophrenia as well and that it's genetic and that it's going to get me as well. This is what's been fueling my anxiety the past week. I finally worked up the courage this morning to ask my dad about it before going to work. He told me that she hasn't 'been all there' since she got hit by a car in her teens. Meaning that whatever mental disability she has was environmental and not genetic. Other than this aunt, my family has no history of mental disorders. And to go back on the drug related parts of the story, I am very confident that I'd be fine today if I hadn't chose to smoke weed after previously having LSD induced anxiety. Because like I said before my LSD induced anxiety was pretty much faded away up until I smoked weed. It revived it and made it worse, I finally realized that my brain doesn't agree with THC. And if I can take back the fact I dropped acid and smoked weed I most certainly would. I really enjoyed my experience with acid but that mental torment caused by anxiety just was not worth it.

First a bit of background. Last year of university I had a traumatic experience that developed into episodes of debilitating depression and anxiety, to the point of being scared to leave the house. I managed  to graduate and got a job working 15 hours a week which felt really manageable. The pay is not much but it covers my insurance plan which allows me to get medicine and treatment. I started therapy and  gained some insight on how to cope with anxiety. Now I landed another job which doesn’t pay a lot but it’s remote so I get a lot of freedom.

It’s 3:00 and haven’t slept. My day starts at 6:00.  I only have to go twice a week but it is really messing with my mind and quality of life. I was doing the math and on bad weeks I can stay 24 hrs without sleeping, then get a nap and go another 12 awake.

Freaking out typing this post :/

Previously (April-May) had been on Lorazepam and desvenlafaxine for lack of sleep and what I believe to be anxiety and panic attacks related to poor sleep. Didn't mind lorazepam but desvenlafaxine was not very good for me (felt like I could fall over the crazy ledge any time), I quit cold turkey after a month (desvenlafaxine 50mg low dose) and even with a low dose suffered the consequences for a week (felt like my brain was connected to a 9v battery). I don't even know why the heck I was prescribed desvenlafaxine for panic attacks and anxiety but I had enough of it and this fixing the underlying cause BS after this.

Thought I was over it all, I was making sure to let the triggers get me, but something I can't control is sleep. Worked late till 4AM (not forced or anything, I just zoned out and was in the flow) 2 days ago and it has been all downhill from there. No sleep on first night and severe panic attacks on second night. Saw doc today morning first thing and he prescribed lorazepam and risperidone.

Now I don't have a problem with lorazepam but why the actual fuck do I need what appears to be an even more side-effecty anti-psychotic called risperidone added to that? Sorry, I don't trust a lot of people including the doc to get this right other than people who actually went through the same thing.

Anyway, I need to get this out.

I've dealt with anxiety since at 20 years old, me and my boyfriend at the time broke up. 
I smoked some weed like 3 or 4 times and the Panic attacks hit.  They lasted for a whole hour sometimes, it was fucking awful. 
I stopped smoking weed but the anxiety didn't end there.

Fast forward to today and I don't have panic attacks anymore, but I have irritable bowl syndrome, I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee, I'm tired all the fucking time. So much that I feel like a 60 year old trapped in a 23 year old young woman's body. Also, my belly gets so swollen that someone already asked me if I'm pregnant (I'm a slim girl).

When something in my routine changes (like now, that I work and study), I get chest pains, difficulties at breathing and just that constant not at the stomach all the time. I feel like I'm about to have a meltdown at anytime.

I don't really think I overthink now, I used to, but now it's better. The fucked up thing is that all the symptoms are there, and I feel like no one really gets me, since they think I'm stressing out with something I'm thinking about or whatever. It's not the case.

I’ve barely had any water the last day and a half because my water bottle is no longer useable and it’s not safe to use anything else (disabilities also complicate that) but thanks for that OCD - it’s being such a dick lately and I’m trying to talk myself through it all so I don’t yell at my housemate for something that’s really not worth yelling over - I know that x thing shouldn’t make y unsafe - but it does. 

I don’t have a social life at all - people are wanting to see me and the social anxiety and agoraphobia has gotten so bad I can’t reply to texts or answer the phone or even interact with food delivery people.

Legit my family is worried now which is scary and hilarious because my family were completely oblivious to so many thing s but I don’t answer a few calls and suddenly everyone’s panicking and I just want to be left alone I don’t have the energy to mask for them.

I was pretty much housebound for 6 weeks coz of medical hellstorm and the anxiety just took that opportunity to dig in and isolate.

Even friends 5 minutes up the road who are like parents to me - I can’t interact with - they want to help, they want to bring food or take us grocery shopping or whatever we need but I can’t do the interaction.

I cancelled my dr appointment today - ended up having a long phone convo with her anyway and worked out a plan.

She believes in me so much. You’ve done this before - you can build it back up again, millimeter by millimeter... it’s strange - that emotional intimacy with a good doctor who has seen your highest and your lowest and everything in between. 

I tried to push back like a week ago and start rebuilding - ended with getting attacked by an out of control dog and crappy owner and I passed out (coz medical condition was flaring from walking). I was just walking my service dog. I was in view of my home - and I got attacked.

I just arrived at university on Saturday, and I am really struggling. I’m living in a college, so I share a kitchen with 5 other flatmates in our corridor. This is situated in a block (which has multiple corridors) - there are three blocks in the college itself. 

A bit of background - I used to be quite social at school, but my best friend treated me like shit, so I isolated myself and stopped talking to anyone. I walked around with earbuds in. I became very anxious, thinking that people hated me, and I only really had one or two friends that I talked to. I skipped on lunch and so never had the energy to play sport and develop friendships through that. I survived until the end of school, did alright in my exams and now I’m at university.

Over the summer my anxiety got better - I worked a job on a maintenance team for a school, and gradually I opened up and got better at talking. However, I arrived at uni and all the anxiety has come back. My flatmates are alright, but most only care about partying, getting drunk/high, which is fine, but I don’t enjoy that. The college has arranged events to go to, but I only went to one, a board games night. I have mostly just sat in my flat on my own all day, or slept to avoid having to go to the kitchen to eat. I am too nervous to talk to anyone. There is another person in my corridor who is quiet like me - I’ve tried talking to him, but I don’t think he likes me. There’s a girl that always arranges to go to events with him - I like her, she seems nice but they never ask me.

The thing is, my parents have been contacting me asking if I’m enjoying it and what I’ve been up to. I told them that I was going to go to this massive dinner that they have planned for us tonight. However it’s an 8 hour ordeal involving drinking and dancing and I really don’t want to go. My parents know that I struggled at school but they think that I’m going to have the time of my life, but I think it’ll end up being the same as at school. They’re already missing me so much and I don’t want to pile onto that by telling them that I’m missing out on everything and not making any friends.

It's hard for me because we used to talk daily about a lot of things, even when they've not been feeling very social, and I've started to look forward to our conversations. Expecting them? Which is probably too much, and not.. I don't know, good? 

I just keep thinking that I specifically did something wrong, when I know I probably didn't. I keep thinking I lost them as a friend or they're dead, I keep obsessing over it. Even though I know I'm probably wrong.

I have generalized anxiety, though, I've been thinking maybe it's something else. A misdiagnosis, but I don't know. Something more intense than generalized anxiety? Can't afford a doctor or therapist to find out.

I can't sleep at night. When I'm awake, I have daily panic attacks, mini ones throughout the day. I'm an artist, and I can hardly hold a pencil because my hands are shaking too much.

There's more than the friend worry, but that's what's being loud right now. I just want them to feel okay. Because, while everyone's situation is different, I know what it's like to want to die, to withdraw and not talk to anyone. I'm going through similar feelings. It's not good. I just, I want to help. But I can't help if they don't talk to me.

I offered my help, and I feel really bad because of my personal reaction. I didn't know that I would start to obsess over thoughts that aren't true. Thoughts like, ""oh they died because they didn't react to the meme you sent them"" and ""oh they must hate you, because you're annoying."" 

I absolutely know not everything is about me, and I hate that my anxiety won't let me feel otherwise. 

I thought I had a handle on my anxiety, that I knew how to ride it out. My friend is going through some hard shit, and they shouldn't have to feel like they're doing something wrong by sharing that with me. I feel horrible about my reaction, even though I'm suffering in secret.

I'm not going to tell them what I'm going through, because that would make them feel worse, and probably make them keep their feelings bottled up until they're at their own breaking point.

I offered my help, and that should be enough, the torch is in their hand, so to speak. But I just. I'm so scared. About a lot of things. More than just my friend worry. I don't know what to do.

My friend and her friend decided to join in on this and this made me break down in my dream. I started to cry, ran away and the dream ended.

Alright here is the second one. It's basically the same except, it was my family that was making fun of me.

I am the eldest of 3. We are all in our 20’s. I seem to spend the majority of my life worrying about my siblings, parents and my husband. I worry about something bad happening to them, the choices they make and if they’re happy. For example my brother has recently split with his long term girlfriend and I spend nights wide awake wondering if he is going to start doing drugs/that he is drinking too much/that he isn’t eating well. He has been going out every night till the early morning and I worry about him being involved in an accident etc.  He is very easily influenced and I appreciate that I can’t stop him as he has his own choices to make but I can’t stop worrying about him messing his life up. I try not to talk to him  about it as it’s not my life. He isn’t coping with the end of the relationship and I feel at a total loss of how to help him.

I worry about my sister and her relationship as they argue a fair amount, and she has left him a few times and been really unhappy as she realises that what they argue about is not worth ending the relationship and so goes back to him. I feel like I’m constantly  waiting for something to happen-that they will split up. They are quite temperamental and act in haste. Again, I know I can’t stop them doing that but I end up picking up the pieces and I think it’s affecting me more than I thought but I can’t stop worrying about them. She will text/call me when they have a row and need lots of help but won’t answer me if I enquire to how they are doing-and she always has her phone on her. She can also be quite horrible with her temper towards me if I don’t say the right thing and I struggle with this a lot as it makes me so anxious to think I’ve upset her. 

I worry about my mum having health problems-because she always worries about getting a terminal disease and will panic every time she is ill. She is extremely scared of dying and I worry about her dying too as I know how terrified she is of it. I worry constantly that I’m doing something that would disappoint or annoy my dad-my siblings have this wonderful relationship with my parents where they can tell them anything but I can’t. I used to be able to tell my mum stuff but she used to tell people about it and I’m now so scared of being judged by others I can’t open up.

TL;DR - anxiety has gotten unmanageable again and I'm having trouble coping 

So, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and GAD when I was 13 (9 years ago)...I ""managed"" (suffered through) it for nearly 7 years with no medication, until I was prescribed an antidepressant (Trintellix) and xanax for panic attacks. 

I've had two periods in my life where I have been panic attack free. Once from 16 - 17, and about a month ago, I was approaching my second month with no panic attacks and a good maintenance of daily anxiety...

Then, life happened. Two weeks ago. And it's been hell ever since.

I am a college student (senior), and my academic advisors fucked me over and after being recently told I was set to graduate this spring, I was told I am short credits and need to stay for an extra semester. School is my biggest stressor, so this really threw me for a loop and made me lose my mind. Two days later, my pet dies of old age and pneumonia. One week later, my friend visits for my birthday and I am not left alone for a single second (I love my friend, but she was staying at my place for a week and it was extremely claustrophobic - especially because I was still processing the events of the prior week). 

Because of my increased anxiety, I've increased how often I take xanax (I used to only take it once or twice a week, I'm taking it almost every day now) and I've now run out of pills and my insurance won't let me fill a new prescription (that I got from my doctor, with a new dose) until October 15th. 

My panic attacks are very physically violent - they include me hyperventilating to the point of almost passing out and/or forceful vomiting. I had three of these attacks yesterday morning at school...each lasting over an hour. 

I am waking up having panic attacks now, every single day - without fail...and nothing I do seems to stop them....they're getting longer, stronger, and overall, worse. My anxiety has made me mildly agoraphobic, so I can't even make it to my therapists office and have to keep cancelling my appointments with her. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to turn. I don't know how to function. I don't know when this will pass, if it will ever pass, but I feel so exhausted and defeated right now that I can barely leave my bed. I've thankfully been keeping down water, but in the past 2 weeks I've had maybe 4 full meals that I was able to keep down.

I have a family history of MS but my doctor said he never heard of that being a symptom of MS. I think maybe it could be psychosomatic. Like how when you think of breathing you do it manually, but the thing is even when I’m not thinking about it it happens sometimes. It’s not the first weird neurological thing I’ve had happen and be dismissed by doctors either. In early 2017 I went to the hospital because when I was driving I got pins and needles in my teeth, then mouth, then it spread over my whole body. To the rhythm of the pins and needles for lack of a better term I began to shake uncontrollably and was paralyzed. I managed to fight against my own body and pull my car over. I fell out of the car and forced my fingers that barely worked to call 911. When I spoke my speech was slurred and barely comprehensible, I could just say ambulance. Not sure if one side of my face was sagging and I thought maybe it was a ministroke or something but everyone said that was somehow a panic attack. You know, despite not being panicked and completely calm beforehand, but alright. After that, or maybe a bit earlier I’d been getting petechiae on the tops of my feet too. I get them around my body now, tiny bleeding under the skin, and again, Canada’s finest doctors who don’t give a shit prove they don’t give a shit and I’ve had repeated complete blood counts that aside from a slightly elevated white blood cell count indicating possibly a slight infection there’s nothing.

t2_3eywp37d," How are you!!! How are you doing!! People usually ask me whenever I am meeting with them. Well physically I am doing fine but I am emotionally mentally not feeling well.  

People are reluctant to understand that Mental Health is a Real important factor for well being.

Mental Wellbeing includes our emotional psychological and social wellbeing. It affects our daily life. Being not mentally well affects our choice and decision making.  Mental distress, anxiety, depression all these are REAL not just Medical fantasy Terms.

Abusive and discouragement treatment within the family during my childhood are main contributed factors for my mental health issues.  Beating kids or spanking kids is the common socially accepted parenting trait. Parents often admit that they have no other choice but to use force to discipline their kids. Well in my case I was never been demanding spoiled kid. Even today my parents agree on this matter.

So why did they beat me!! The answer lies in our competitive school exam systems. Our society is kind of obsessed with school grades, people are literally giving their judgemental remarks about the kids on the base of school grades. Kids often face discriminatory treatment because of school grades. If you have great school grades then people give you special attention and you are like becoming the “Star” “Sun” “Moon” of the neighbourhoods.  If you were poor mediocre student like me who was literally struggling with her studies especially in mathematics in her school days then people gave you pathetic sympathetic look and made you feel guilty. Having poor grades in school is like a Serious crime, it is worse than killing someone.

Somehow parents are always linked their social status or prestigious reputation with their kid’s school grades.  They bet on their reputation social status on the kid’s scorecard. Parents easily justify their overly pressured parental tactics on their kids with simple words: we want a bright future for them.

From my experience the act of spanking a kid does not simply hurt him physically – it is the emotional sting of it that causes the worst effects. Yess!!  My parents.. my father was often beat me up because of my poor mathematics grades. Mathematics exams were my nightmares. My parents were literally behaving like cruel villains and they were always ready with their beating tools to beat me up if I failed to secure less than 80 percent.  In my middle school (7th grade) my father brutally beat me with his belt and I had so my many bruises in my back.  Result days were like final judgement day. I was literally beaten up every year because of my poor school grades. In my high school final, I just scored only 66% and my father bluntly told it was better for me if  I commit suicide. I was thinking of committing suicide and tried too. I just wanted to die. And my anxiety disorder symptoms have started from that day.

School grades and the rat race among parents are the root cause of the mental stress of every student here in our society. The students suffer from anxiety and traumatic disorder relating to fear of examination. The fear factor is the reason why students suffer from anxiety, depression, and the following consequences. And the fear not only comes from the school society but also from parents, who go to extreme levels to push their children into getting better grades. Every hour, one student commits suicide in India, according to 2015 data (the latest available) from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

It’s not at all surprising for me. I had .. I have been going through the same hell like all other students.  Fulfilling the expectations of the parents are kind of huge burden for every student out there.  I never have that moral encouraging support from my parents from the very beginning.. Right now I am doing my specialisation in law and for my father, I am still a hopeless kid.

Right now I am taking help from my psychologist to overcome my anxiety disorder. Here even taking help from a psychologist is big TABOO. We need to talk about mental stress and seek help if needed. Mental stress is a serious condition that requires medical help.

t2_4nf4aios,"Recently, I have discovered that I am genuinely the most indecisive person out there, and I blame society's lack of care in terms of developing young children and the education system's lack of understanding and connecting with children.

I have this form of extreme anxiety whenever starting anything new. My views become extremely depressing and pessimistic, I think about all the negatives that may come from my choices.

I started school a month ago. In this one month, I switched classes 4 times and majors two times, going between Humanities and STEM classes till I stuck with STEM as I found it to interest me more.

I always feel slow when it comes to taking decisions, and the fear of regret and failure is a captivating thought that ceases to disappear.

I get anxiety when starting school, starting a new job, volunteering. I'm not diagnosed by any means, but my girlfriend is, and I share similar symptoms to her... although my anxiety is only a fraction of what she deals with.

I also fear for my future - my parents have pressured me to be an engineer or a doctor my entire life, and I keep thinking that if I won't get into those fields then I will be a failure, yet at the same time I acknowledge that this is not true, but there's just that feeling that sticks with you if you don't do what is expected of you.

Generally I'm a very head-on person, but this year was different. I suppose as I age, I begin to acknowledge responsibilities from a different perspective.

I wish to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering or Software Development, or anything related to computers, but I know for a fact the first month of me majoring in ANY field, regardless of passion, amounts to nothing as I will struggle immensely with depression and anxiety for reasons I myself can't seem to comprehend. 

I need help: I'm not stupid, I'm not dumb, but my recent academic failures have been entirely due to factors related to my mental health, and I can't seem to find a solution. Living in the Middle East, inquiring about mental health amongst parents will not be an option as I'm: A) surrounded by people who will substitute proven science with ""praying"" as the solution, and B) because I can't help myself as I'm not yet an adult, and even if I could: the hospitals here have the right to deliver your mental health records in the event any potential employers shall request them, disposing of specific opportunities to come simply because society works in an obscure demeanor. 

I need your advice on how to conquer anxiety of new chapters that may come in life, as well as coping with the hardships in life as far as academics go, and how to get over the fear of failure or disappointment. I very clearly remember crying in 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Grade for starting school and my anxiety was over the roof, despite knowing great people and having a blast throughout most of those years, but the fear of the unknown is haunting; yet ironically I have the balls to be the first person to enter a dark room in a ""haunted house"" setting for example.

t2_9ytc2,"Last winter, I was very anxious almost all the time. I had frequent insomnia, and I felt like I was very frequently on the verge of panic during the day, while sober. 

In April, I started to feel bad chest discomfort and felt my heart beating hard (not fast, it made spasm slightly at every heartbeat) almost 24/7. I then started to feel very lethargic, had no energy, shortness of breath and I was certain that I had some sort of heart disease. I stopped working out regularly and was listening to every sign my body was giving me.

In May, I ended up in the ER because of what I thought was an irregular heartbeat. I got assigned to do various tests (echocardiogram, EKG, stress test, holter), and got thorough bloodwork done.

As the summer went by, I got my results for those tests. Everything was pointing to my heart being healthy. But, I just didn't **feel** right, I didn't feel normal. I was always too aware of my heartbeat and spasming, or I felt tired, or I felt lightheaded. Part of me felt that I was being very irrational, since I was a 22 year old who was very physically active before my symptoms started and never had a health problem. But still, I was very careful when exerting myself and restrained myself from doing too many things and became overly avoidant.

Fast forward to today, I went to see my cardiologist. He told me explicitly : \`\`You're heart is normal, you can do anything. You crushed your stress test, your heart's shape is normal and your arrythmia is benign\`\`.

So, I didn't sleep yesterday, which meant I had had a total of 5 hours across 50+ hours and none in the past 28. Then, like the fucker my body is, it decided to have a panic attack. Then, again like a fool, I didn't eat.  

It was the worst thing I have ever been through. So, imagine a normal panic attack, feels like your about to die, can't breathe etc. Now add that with the feeling that you are floating above your body and you literally can't think, breathe, move, it felt like I didn't even exist. Everything was too close, I couldn't even feel my arms and hands, the only thing that I could do to keep myself in reality was to pinch myself, really hard, so hard, that now 7 hours later, the marks are as clear as they were then. I couldn't do persepctive, so when I tried to stand up, I walked into everything around me (like literally just bashing/ bouncing off walls), I couldn't talk or make any explanations, all I could do is tell my gf that I thought I was going to pass out, and that I couldn't deal with today, that I wouldn't/couldn't make it through.

I sincerely thought I was going to die, and not in the normal panic attack way. More, death would be okay right now, death would be a good way out of this, I'm going to die, my body can't keep doing this. 

In summary, I have now realised the extent my body can cope with. And that I should eat, sleep and drink, or else everything shuts down.

The problem was that there aren't any girls at my school or work that I find attractive. So my friend suggested I try a dating app. So I got on bumble and started swiping. 

It took a while but a few weeks ago I finally got matched with someone who seemed genuinly interested in me and didn't just ghost after a few messages like all my previous matches did. So I asked her out, she said yes and gave me her number.

We saw a movie on Saturday, I picked her up from her dorm. I was pretty nervous before but once she got in the car and we just started talking my nerves subsided. I was having a pretty good time talking and flirting with this girl. It was a feeling I hadn't felt in a realllly long time.

We saw the movie, and ended up sitting pretty close by the end of it. Movie finished, I asked if she wanted to get food but she said she had to work (she's an RA on her floor so she sometimes has really late shifts). So I drove her back to her dorm, conversation still being pretty fun. I felt like it went well.

When I dropped her off she said she had a great time and that she wanted to hang out again, so I should text her. Well I did that. Later that night when I was home I sent her a text basically saying ""thanks for hanging out with me tonight, I had a lot of fun and I'm excited to get to know you more! You free next weekend?""

Annnnnnd, over 2 days later nothing. I'm not broken up about it just kinda pissed that she would lead me on if she didn't intend to follow up.

&amp;#x200B;

The concept of engaging our emotions for dealing with depression naturally

To fight depression effectively, we need to realize that it’s just a feeling after all.

We have all sorts of emotions during the day.

Depression is just one of them, even though it’s a powerful one.

Tim Matthews, the founder of The Powerful Man, gives one good example of how we create it:

&gt;“When we start to think that we should be farther ahead than who and where we are now, we begin to feel so much pressure which can lead to depression.”

Even if we feel depressed, we can switch to another emotion instantly.

For example, I feel love whenever I give a hug to my kid.

Which means I can switch to that emotion voluntarily.

My current emotion is the one that I choose to feel by focusing on it.

Tony Robbins has this concept called the Triad.

Changing our feeling requires changing the following three things: 

1. physiology: posture and breathing
2. focus: what we think about
3. language: what we say to ourselves when we think about it

Here I am talking about the second part: *focus*.

Let me show how I replace a negative emotion with a positive one using my focus.

**Step #1: Have a memory associated with a strong positive emotion**

I have this memory of feeling like a winner.

A few years ago, I went to a park on a date with a girl.

We took a walk for about an hour.

When we returned to my car, I pushed the button on the door to unlock it.

But it wouldn’t unlock.

I was confused because my key was supposed to be in my pocket and the car was supposed to unlock.

But what if I didn’t have the key?

I looked around for the key but it was nowhere to be found.

I lost it indeed.

So I called a taxi to take the girl home and grab the second key from my home.

In the morning, I decided to go look for the key.

I thought that would be a waste of time.

I mean what are the chances to find the key in a huge park where we walked a lot.

But somehow I trusted my intuition.

I drove back to the park and started following our yesterday’s path.

I was 100% sure I had no chance.

A large park, high grass, and a small key.

And sure enough, there it was, lying in the grass, waiting for me.

Man, this looked like a miracle.

I felt ecstatic for so many reasons.

I don’t like to lose things and I avoided losing the key.

It was quite expensive to restore and I didn’t want the hassle.

And most importantly, I couldn’t believe that I actually found it.

It might not sound like a big deal to you.

But it doesn’t matter!

What does matter is that for me it was a miracle.

I couldn’t believe it.

And I committed this feeling to memory.

**Step #2: Rely on this memory to recall the emotion**

Now I use this memory as a go-to place for things like winter depression or any other negative thoughts really.

See, I noticed that it could help me just a couple of days after finding the key.

I was running and really pushing myself.

It felt hard, but then I suddenly remembered about the key.

And running felt less difficult instantly.

So I said to myself:

“If I can use this memory to change my state when I run, how about other situations?”

So the next time I felt depressed, I replayed that memory.

I recreated the entire experience in my mind as vividly as possible.

Summer park smells.

Sounds of the wind in the trees.

How the morning sun felt on my skin.

How I noticed the key.

The unbelievable feeling of victory.

The gratitude about trusting my intuition.

And feeling happy telling the girl that I found it.

Replaying that memory took me about two minutes.

And it was already worthwhile because at least in those few minutes, I didn’t feel depressed.

I felt elated.

But it didn’t really last just two minutes.

In fact, I stayed elated.

And I would keep reminding myself of the key from time to time.

That was enough to renew my focus.

And whenever I felt depression coming back strong, I replayed the entire experience again for a stronger effect.

That's it: dealing with depression naturally is that easy!

**Step #3: Keep programming yourself**

As I kept using this memory, it worked even more effectively.

The idea is to make it so habitual that it happens automatically.

In fact, we do it with negative emotions all the time.

We keep thinking of something bad and we feel depressed.

That’s because our mind is focused on survival and keeps looking for what is wrong.

But if we can train ourselves to feel negative emotions, we can do the same with the positive ones!

It just takes more practice and patience.

As we practice shifting from negative to positive emotions, we program them into our subconscious mind.

And eventually, we are able to call those positive emotions just as quickly as the negative ones.

Start dealing with depression naturally today

**Conclusion**

There you go: there is no reason for living with depression when it’s just a matter of focus.

Instead of focusing on what’s bad in your life, you have the power to focus on a positive emotion.

Find a memory when you felt elated. It doesn’t have to be as big as winning a Nobel prize. What matters is how excited you felt at the moment.

Replay that moment in your mind in detail so that you feel the positive emotions in your body.

And then keep focusing on those positive emotions to avoid the negative ones.

When you feel that the negative emotions start creeping back in, replay the moment in detail again.",Dealing with Depression Naturally - Feel Better FAST Without Medication,Anxiety,0,dpztug,False

t2_4x5zq11z,"This is a throwaway account because this is a bit of a personal issue and I wanted to remain anonymous.

For context, I am a white male with long hair, and I live in Texas. Despite the fact the some may consider my appearance to be that of a “pothead”, I have extreme anxiety surrounding doing illegal things. I follow rules and the law to the best of my ability.

Today, I was pulled over by a state trooper because my rear left taillight was out. I knew it was out and planned on changing it extremely soon. I figured he simply wanted to let me know about it. He had me roll my window down and explained just that. I handed him my insurance and ID card and he asked me if I still lived at the same address, to which I replied that I did.

He then asked me to get out of my vehicle. I immediately became extremely nervous, because I had zero idea why I would need to. Nevertheless, I complied and slowly got out of my vehicle. We stepped onto the side of the road to talk.

He started by asking “when was  the last time you smoked marijuana?”

External note for reddit: I have never smoked marijuana. I do not sell marijuana. I am never around marijuna. I am a bit of a loner and therefore never have anyone in my car besides my fiancee, who also has never smoked. She is very against doing drugs. I simply abstain from doing drugs because I am so paranoid and anxious of being caught. 

I replied that I had never smoked marijuana before. He claimed that he smelled marijuana in my vehicle and knew I had been smoking. I explained to him again that I have never smoked. He asked if anyone had been in my car who had been smoking, to which I explained the above bit about how no one is ever in my car. He then asked if I had any marijuana in my vehicle, to which I said no. He said that I needed to be careful who I hang around because I could get in a lot of trouble.

He told me to wait in the grass where he could see my hands, where he took my ID card to look me up. I stood there, dazed, confused, and on the verge of a panic attack. I tried as hard as I could to retain my composure.

He stepped out and he handed me a small piece of paper to sign that said I understood my infraction (taillight being out) and said there was no ticket/fine. He once again reiterated that I need to be careful who I hangout with and told me to have a good day.

Overall he was very respectful and did not come across as rude or hostile, but I immediatey started having one of the worst panic attacks of my life once I got into my vehicle and drove off. 

This happened 10 hours ago. I deal with moderate depression and anxiety and I have felt at an all time low due to this. I have always been a very good kid who follows the rules, I received
my IB diploma in highschool and had good grades. I’ve never been arrested and never gotten in any legal trouble. I have never taken drugs. About the most illegal thing I’ve ever done is checking my phone while driving.

I cannot shake this insane sense of anxiety and depressive feeling that this has caused. Did a police officer lie to me about smelling marijuana? Did he stereotype me? Could someone have been smoking in a parking lot near my car? 

I just wanted to write how I feel and I wonder if anyone has ever been in the same situation? I know that the situation could have been a lot worse and I realize I am lucky I did not get a ticket, or even hurt. But this entire experience has me feeling traumatized.

I’m working two jobs, 6 days a week to make more money. I stress about losing my income. Some of it comes from my mother who recently broke down in front of me because I wasn’t making enough money and she was scared about not being able to pay the bills. 

I’m also managing a rental property and its tenants, which means fixing their plumbing issues, internet issues, people moving in and out, etc. And my little brother suspects he has ADD and it’s fallen upon me to get him checked out, my older brother has depression, intrusive thoughts and a physical illness that could render him disabled if he suffers a hard fall, my mother is borderline bipolar and loves to overreact to small problems, and my dad doesn’t know a single thing about running a household and leaves it up to me and my mother.

t2_4x78arem,"Back in 2017 after my daughter was born I had a breakdown, I was 18 had a newborn, stressful job, a rocky relationship and the pressure just got too much. I lost my job, partner and have stayed in doors pretty much ever since,

Since then my life has been in pieces, I had another job in 2018 but lost it due to being too nervous to confront my boss about how he was treating me so I just left, I’ve been looking for work ever since.

My health has declined, I’m overweight, I don’t sleep or socialise and I have awful thoughts.

My family doesn’t understand as I’m “not the type” Ive been claiming benefits because I’m looking for work, but the truth is I can’t. Every time a job opportunity comes up I buckle, I can’t answer the phone, I can’t leave the house. 

I signed up to an agency and got a job offer, on the day I knew I couldn’t handle it and called to cancel, but I was so nervous about the phone call. I called quickly and broke down to the poor women on the phone and just told her I wasn’t ready and hung up, I nearly passed out.

Now the day has come where I have to explain to my doctor, I have no idea what to say. I’ve been here before to get sick notes but all those times I feel like it looked like I was just trying to bunk off of work. I also have to explain this to the job centre.

I’ve not even told my mum that I’m planning on stopping my work search I don’t know what to say there either. My family just think I’m being lazy.

I can barely speak to people, I can’t take phone calls, I can’t even answer my own door. The depression is bad and it feels like the only way to let everyone know is to hurt myself.

I have tried therapy before but ended up abandoning it, anti depressants help but then I’m just existing. Neither happy or sad. 

I have finances, board to pay and my daughter to think about. Should I go for sick pay? Can I even get that? 

I have an appointment with a therapist on the 18th of Nov. I just don’t know if anyone will understand. 

What do I say to my doctor? My support worker? My own mum?

What is it that’s wrong with me? I know in my gut there’s something wrong.

While there were times I had fun, I could not stop thinking about how people perceived me. It’s something I realize every now and then - I forget I have social anxiety until I realize the whole reason i forget is because i am anxious 24/7. I’m anxious in person, I’m anxious online, it doesn’t matter - I’m constantly extremely worried about how I am perceived and people’s’ opinions of me. When there were pauses between performances, all I could think about was how so many people there were able to be comfortable, let loose, just dance, while I can’t make a single move without worrying what might happen. Someone will think I’m a bad dancer and make fun of me, I’ll accidentally hit someone, I’ll take up too much space - in my mind I never deserve space. I’m taking away something from someone else who deserves it more than I do.

Soo I have had alot of insecurities in my life, and almost all of them are related to looks. Coincidentally almost all of my biggest insecurities are things that my family in one way or another shamed me for. But I have one that has controlled my life alot more than any other. It's about my penis.

A few years ago I made a similar post about the same issue (another account) and you had some great answers. I was 17 at the time and I had avoided sexual interactions as much as I possibly could, because I was so terrified of what they would think of the size of my penis ( size is 6.4 inches in lenght and 4.6 inches in girth. It's mainly the girth that is troubling me.). Anyways I took alot of the advice and for a long time I saw a big improvement. I decided to go for my dream girl and I got her! Nothing of the bad things I thought would happen actually happened. We have actually been together for a couple of years now!

At the beginning I was feeling confident for the first time in my life. But that slowly died out. Even though I feel better now than I ever did before the anxiety and feelings of inadequacy never really leaves me, and its always related to my penis. Sometimes I see things from a different perspective, ""maybe my penis is perfectly fine, maybe I am enough"". Those feelings and thoughts proves just to be temporary though and the negative thoughts starts coming back. So when I do have these negative thoughts (which is about 70% percent of the time) the following behaviour and feelings occurs. Rumination (It becomes everything I can think about), Anxiety (mostly over sex, even with my own girlfriend), self measuring every day, videofilming myself naked from different angles everyday, and seeking some type of confirmation on the issue on blogs and forums.

THIS. NEVER. STOPS. I AM SO TIRED OF THIS. No matter how many times I do these silly things like measure myself it never satisfies me. I do it agian and agian hoping to get some more information that will make understand the issue more clearly, but it never comes. I have thought about seing a therapist but I can't fucking imagine sharing this in person. I'm ashamed. Everything else in my life is going great, and I am happy with it all but this really fucks my quality of life up. Enough is enough, I want to take my Life back.

In a way I resent the need for this person to pay attention to me, but I linger; checking my phone to see if they've messaged - it fills up that nagging emptiness and fear, if only momentarily. But I don't smother them, I accept they have a life outside of me and other things going on, it's not a selfish thing. I wouldn't even go so far as to say I'm insecure, as I'm happy being my own person outside of the times I connect with someone.

t2_1huq632w,"Wanted to share a curious development in my life that, to the initatiated, may not seem so surprising.

28yo now and as a kid I definitely had anxiety. The suffer in silence type. When it came to anything even mildly nerve-racking to someone with less anxiety I would have butterflies brawling in my stomach. Talking to girls or people I didn't know, standing up and introducing myself or presenting... I would seize up inside, voice would tremble, I could not think straight and I would converse like a buffoon. 

Anyways... the main point here is to look back at my butterlies or, as others describe it, that ugly, nasty pit in your stomach which I think most of us get.

They're gone.

After my first ever and very major panic attack last year... it almost never came back. I noted this with my therapist and doctors. It's crazy. For over a year I do not remember it even coming back a little. 

Well maybe a tiny bit... tracing back to about 4 weeks ago I had a major presentation at a local university to give to a room of highly qualified individuals in my field. I got the butterflies back right before I went up and they went away as usual. That was the last I saw of them.

Had a second major panic attack at work the following week where paramedics came and I had to take a week off. Is it connected that they came back during a period of high stress? Maybe.

And now, 4 weeks later I have noticed... during the same situations that, in the past, would have triggered a Cage Match in my stomach now triggers other, classical, symptoms of anxiety. Symptoms like room spinning, brain fog, dizziness, a sense of doom and panic, my short term memory sucks now ect..... no butterflies.

Am I complaining? Somewhat. I wish I had those butterlies back. They were so much easier to contend with vs the symptoms I have now. Eventually, like the butterflies, I will wrestle these symptoms down from excruciating to bearable but, to be honest, I miss them. They were not that bad.

Don't be afraid of thought forms. We all make them constantly. If you see one you do not like, just visualize what you do want and replace the old with the new. Otherwise, let them come and go on their own.


Julia

Julia Assante PhD


www.juliaassante.com 

I'm worried I will have to constantly imagine destroying this thought forms as a new compulsion. 

I have a really weird metaphysical obession where I fear I will enter the perspective/mind of someone bad. As mad as it sounds, I saw a video by teal swan who provided a visualization technique on how to do this. And in magick I've seen several visualizations that seem to support this idea. Such as assumption 


""You just visualize your target person (with your eyes open) in front of you, a real living image of the person you wish to match.

It might take you a few minutes to really get into the feeling of them being there. And when you feel that image of them is as real as you can make it, you just physically step into it.

(Of course, to someone watching, you are stepping into nothing but an empty space on the floor)

As you step into that image, now feel yourself as that person. The trick is not to feel yourself as you within them but instead to feel you as that person...there should be no feeling of separation.

If you get it right, you will almost feel like you are not yourself anymore.

And in this state of vibrational attunement, thoughts will pass easily between the two of you, and things that you think you want to do (as them), they will also be thinking they want to do...if they are in a situation where they can be receptive to their thoughts in that moment.

Me &amp; my girlfriend (well, fiancée now) are very naturally vibrationally in-tune so it's quite easy for me (using this method) to pick up her thoughts, or make her look towards me when she is off in the distance across a crowded room, or get in touch when she is uncontactable by normal means.

How you use a method like this is really up to you and your imagination.

It's also a great way to get rapport with someone you wish to like you, for example, at a job interview. You just step into the person interviewing you while they are interviewing you and you'll both seem to be on the same wavelength...because literally you will be :)

Of course, you don't literally get up out of your seat and step into an image of them while they are talking to you, you just do it in your mind...shifting your body slightly in your seat as you merge with them helps a lot to give you the feeling of stepping into them.

This is a very old occult technique that is spoken about in hushed tones in certain mystical circles because there is a fear that it can be used for the manipulation of others. Indeed, these days you'll get many mind-control and romantic/casual datingauthors selling you this basic method for the sole purpose of manipulating others.

You can waste a lot of time with techniques like this making other people do little things for you here and there. Myself, I spent years playing around with this sort of stuff before I eventually got bored of it.

You see, in the end, it's really quite hard work ""manipulating"" others. :)

I put ""manipulating"" in quotes in that last sentence because ultimately you cannot make anyone do anything they definitely don't want to do. Try it if you don't believe me - nothing bad will happen, you'll just end up disappointed. There's a lot of misguided fear-mongering that goes on with people who warn about using techniques like this...and almost invariably those people have never tried these methods and have no real idea how they work anyway...much like in the world of manifesting techniques, in fact :)

What you'll eventually find about using methods like this to ""manipulate"" others is that it's a hard, painful and ultimately un-satisfying way to live your life.

If you think about it, constantly trying to control the behavior of others makes you a slave to who they are, their whims, their ever-changing moods and fancies. A prison guard is just as much a prisoner as the prisoner s/he is guarding :)""

I saw texts on his phone to a girl named Sarah whom he met online, and they were extremely inappropriate. I was drunk, and confronted him in the Uber. He was drunk too, and we argued for 30 minutes. When we got home, he immediately packed my things and tried to kick me out. He pushed me to the floor. I was too drunk to drive and asked him to let me sleep it off and I’d be gone in the morning.

Excuse my English, it's not my native language.

Context: I was 8 and a ""bully"" (or however you wanna call it), me and my mates used to pick on a boy in our class (because he was short and ginger).

One day, we went to a school trip to a swimming pool, I was having fun with some friends when this boy (Let's call him Tom) appeared, I aproached him and started to mess around. I decided it could be a funny idea if I ""drowned"" him, like pull him underwater then take him out of the water several times.

t2_4x9eh94b,"Hello guys,

A couple months ago I had a recurrence of my anxiety disorder.  It manifests in severe panic attacks, depression and obsessive thinking.  This time around it happened after I tapered off an ssri.  While tapering i started reading message boards of people who were also coming off ssris and internalized all there horror stories about years of suffering, protracted withdrawal, developed an intense fear of PSSD, etc.  I pushed through but couldn’t get rid of the feeling that something was wrong with me, and ended up relapsing into panic disorder.  Now I’m back on medication and it is helping a little, but I am nowhere near where I was before all this.  

The thing is, this isn’t my first time becoming obsessed with catastrophic outcomes.  My first bout with panic disorder when I was a kid, I was obsessed with the typical stuff, heart problems and a fear of schizophrenia (my aunt was schizophrenic).  Later obsessions were MS, fibro, chronic fatigue, borderline personality disorder, and now obsessions over a life ruined by medication.   My physical symptoms of all these things only tend to manifest when I’m extremely anxious.  The thing they all have in common and is they are incurable, vague, would make me an feel like an outcast in society, may be impossible to confirm, and this fear that I can’t trust doctors because they can ruin my life, or may be telling me the wrong thing. 

I am currently obsessing over sexual side effects from my Ssri and feeling like I will have to take it for life and will never have a partner as a result.  The thing is, while there are side effects, I have had a decent sex like on them for years and multiple partners who never complained.  But my brain doesn’t compute that and keeps telling me my dick is going to go numb and stop working entirely any minute and I will be alone forever.  Sometimes I even think it feels cold and I get struck with panic that this is the moment it will happen.  This medication obsession makes it so the medication doesn’t even work that well and I feel guilty taking it, even if it is really helping with my panic attacks. 

Another obsession is that I’m sick somehow but don’t know with what.  I get very Cold when I’m anxious, sometimes my joints hurt, and it sets off catastrophic thinking that it’s something vague and incurable, like fibromyalgia or lymes or ms, and I will never be the same.  Prior to this relapse into anxiety I was working out everyday, eating healthy and had energy.  Now I’m exhausted all the time, have stomach issues, pain, and cognitive problems.  

Even after I squash down one fear, say ms, or sexual fears, or vague medication withdrawal theories, I can’t shake the feeling that something is gravely wrong with me and I will have to live the rest of my life with it, and also that it is somehow my fault.

t2_fesmi,"Hello, first post, long-time lurker.

So... I'm moving apartments... I'm going solo and I've never done this before. I found a place that I was in love with, until yesterday.

The resident manager called me up and begged me to relinquish the place I was accepted for (nothing has been signed yet and no money exchanged). The short story is there is another unit someone else was supposed to move into today that just isn't ready, but there are two other available units, mine and a basement apartment.

The other lady wants a balcony or nothing so he calls to see if I would relinquish my place and take the basement suite so she gets the balcony. 

I'm shook, I don't know what to do... I go down there, the place is dece, so I say sure, but there's no concessions on his end. No offer of a reduced rent, no guaranteed parking spot, not even an agreement to put a chain lock on my front door (I'm a girl... Ground floor apartment...).

I go back to work and everyone here is angry. The boyfriend is angry. Everyone says don't do it, call him back and back out.

So I did. He was understandably grumpy, and I suspect this other lady won't be going through with her lease.

The thing is... She could have temporarily moved into the basement suite until her apartment was ready. That's what he asked me if I wanted to do if I made the move. But why is this suddenly all on my shoulders? I just want the apartment I got accepted for.

I have a walkthrough for my original unit today, where possession becomes official and I'm full of dread now. This sucks so much, I feel sick. I don't know whether his attitude towards me is going to be shitty or whether he's cool because he knows he put me in a difficult position when he shouldn't have. I don't know. My head is a mess, my blood pressure is sky high. 

I am relatively new to the world of highly anxious people... I've had a couple of panic attacks in the past, but ever since the beginning of 2019, I'm pretty much a textbook diagnosis for general anxiety, but I haven't seen my doctor about it yet because I don't even know what to say.

t2_1b5g6q,Hi guys. I'm about to start taking medication for anxiety for the first time and could use some advice for getting through the first week. I've been in therapy for 6 months and 3 months ago started a new job which unfortunately escalated my anxiety to where my therapist and I agreed I should try medication to get it under control. Dr prescribed 10mg celexa (citalopram) and said I could start by splitting to 5mg the first few days if I'm worried about side effects. I have an important presentation at work next Wednesday which I can probably just manage the stress of with skullcap but I'm worried if I start taking the meds now the initial side effects would be worse than how I feel now. I've read a lot of people having extra anxiety and depression when they first start but my doc said it should be an issue...is she lying to make me feel better or is an initial increase in anxiety at the beginning more probable vs just possible?

Talking to Crazy: How to Deal with the Irrational and Impossible People in Your Life by Mark Goulston.

In the book, Mark has the reader run through some exercises to identify their own crazy so they can inoculate themselves when they talk with the crazy people in their lives. (It's a great book by the way and I highly recommend it.)

I've read several other books on anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy so these concepts aren't new.

However, one thing I realized about myself is that when I feel the anxiety coming on, it's more than likely that a trigger has been hit by either my situation, or the person I'm interacting with.

The person I was most afraid to tell was my stepsister. She has a baby girl who was born super small, and likes to squirm around, so I often get afraid I’ll drop her or do something I’ll regret. Often my anxiety would make me think I hurt her in some way: one time I went on vacation with her and she started crying so I tried to play with her, but she kept crying and wouldn’t stop. I thought for at least an hour I shook her too hard (I didn’t shake her more like made her dance but anxiety lol), until she calmed down and was fine again. But I just sat there for an hour thinking “I’m so sorry I hurt the baby!” I told my mom and she said “you can’t keep working yourself up like that.” 

My greatest fear was telling her that and she wouldn’t let me hold the baby again. After all, I could get a panic attack and drop her, since as a newborn I was very anxious about holding her because she was so small, and almost had a panic attack doing it the first time I held her standing up. At least until her boyfriend assured me I was doing fine. 

But I told her mom and she took it really well. I didn’t even make a big spectacle of it, I just gave my niece my anxiety keychain to play with because she likes to grab stuff and when my stepsister asked, I said it was an anxiety keychain and I had anxiety. 

She then asked if it helped me and where to buy some more. And it was like a huge weight got lifted off my chest. 

I think I was worried for nothing. My stepsister works with disabled kids (granted physically disabled mostly), so I’m probably nothing new.

I have suffered from anxiety unknowingly since 15 when I started smoking pot. Me and 3 friends enclosed ourself for about 6 years just in each other’s company smoking pot and playing games. 

We never had much social interaction but when we turned 20-21 we knew it was time to change. We all sort of went our own ways, the other 3 were socially affected to, but they started drinking and taking other ‘social’ drugs to which helped them to become more social. 

But I have always been anxious and insecure since blocking out social interaction. It was really hard work for me to finally ask someone out and when we went out I was pretty nervous and anxious and she read that but she didn’t mind.

I have gone on holiday to Germany for a week without her and I am pretty anxious about getting cheated on, even though I trust her and really don’t think she would cheat on me, but an anxious part of my mind just can’t stop imaging it. 

I’ve dated in the past with girls who have left me early on for someone else and I can’t help but think what if someone does her better and she leaves me you know?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/e3l0yu/best_panic_attack_yet/

About getting through a panic attack relatively easily compared to others. I had some really nice feedback from you guys and was feeling great about the whole thing.

Yesterday I had a fabulous day, went paddleboarding, and snorkelling (sorry it's Florida thats what we do in December) with a friend, and when I got back, I just started feeling off again.

With my attack the other day I was trying to blame caffiene, but this time I hadn't consumed any since that day, and yet the feelings still came up.

Instead of it coming to a head it just kinda lingered, the rest of the day, I felt massively uncomfortable, but it never elevated into a full on attack.

I guess I'm posting this to show that anxiety comes in many different forms, and I'm clearly not out of the woods. Anxiety is something I live with, and can't control, and hopefully I can minimize it as much as possible with a healthy lifestyle, and deal with the waves as they come and go.

t2_3oglf,"So today I figured out, probably like a few times in the past (and then forgot when I was healthy for long periods of time), that

anxiety puts an actual weight or force on your nerves, comparable to the weight / force on your nerves you feel when you do exercise lifting weights higher than normal or when you have to push yourself to do those last 2 extra laps around the track while jogging or running. 

It's the same struggle, the same inability to bear the force or burden and if you exert enough will and grunt it out and fight the depressive force, you get out of the rut.

Brute force on your nerves works for some while, say an hour, till you start slowly imagining and worrying again and get mired in the same heavy web and get bogged down.

Because anxiety and/or depression cause the same strength signals in your nerves that heavy weights or extra running laps produce on your (other) nerves, being able to fight one produces ability to fight the other.

So, developing will power in one activity, translates into will power in other activities. That is to say, regular exercise and use of will power _does_ help you beat anxiety and depression.

So get out of the house, go for a jog, hit the gym, or just do skipping or jumping or spot jogging where you push yourself to the point of fatigue and then a little more beyond it.

As an added bonus, being really exhausted, you will be able to sleep better and being hungry you will be able to eat better.

Stop reading, start exercising. 

Even now, just get up, move away from the computer and start doing some squats or skipping.

It only works if you _do_, not if you _read, like, share, comment or subscribe_ or nod in agreement.

But I know that there is a shortage of beds for the good wards, and I have a love-hate relationship with getting warded. Yes, its a safe place, I get away from the problems from the outside world. I love simple occupational therapy activities like baking, cooking or art where everything you learn is so simplified and therapeutic. But when there are pockets of time with nothing to do, I get bored and pace around, especially if I can't use my phone. Then if I stay too long, I can't wait to get out. With bad wards, my romanticised and idealised notions are often shattered and replaced with stark reality, the reality of how people with mental health issues can just be locked behind closed doors, with nothing to do everyday, and just wait for medicine and discharge time. 

Hence, my favourite thing to do, when I feel unsafe, physically or mentally, is to isolate myself at home, curl up with a good book or watch some youtube videos.

t2_250suv8a,"**Kind of rambled about my anxiety when moved out, skip to last paragraph if too long**

It's a house share with three others in their 20s and 30s, I am 23. I lived at University for over three years, and let's just say it didn't work out too well. The first year was only half a year and the students living there already knew eachother and I was very alone. I never really left my room, but I had good friends at uni so I still did a fair bit of socialising, but I was very anxious and alone when in the flat. 

Second year I lived at halls of residence, which was large and I shared with a lot of students, yet I didn't make a single friend from that residence. I still had a couple of close buddies from the first year who I hung out with on occasion, but other than that I was extremely lonely and got depressed. I stayed in my room all the time, rarely left even to cook or use the toilets. My hygiene was poor because I was too afraid to have a shower, and my diet was poor because I didn't use the kitchen, I mostly used my mini fridge and ate snacks, I was even too afraid to order takeout, and always went shopping at about 1am when there was less people. My anxiety was at its worst.

Third and fourth year (I retook final year because my anxiety and depression had ruined my grades) I lived in a studio flat in private student accommodation, with its own bathroom, double bed, kitchen- the works. I loved it there because I could cook, use the bathroom etc without people around. I also lived next door to my friend at the time. But for some reason I fell into depression even further, ended up completely skipping out on uni for weeks at a time, fell into the wrong crowd, abused drugs (to the point where I was hospitalised twice), made a serious suicide attempt and was evaluated almost being made an impatient at the nearest mental health facility, and ended up losing all my friends because of the person I had become. My anxiety had once again caused me to rarely leave, not go into university, and losing my degree. It got worse before it got better, but it did start to get better.

What are they like? What if they think I am stupid? What if I do something wrong? Can I play my music or will they be annoyed? Will I be allowed to bring guests? What if I wake people when I come in (cause I work nights), what if I will miss out? What will I cook? etc etc. All these questions keep going through my head and I am worried my anxiety will cause me to act like a hermit again.

t2_2s1tsyue,"Hey all,

So some honestly great news - I talked to my family a bit today about my struggles with anxiety and mental health, and I sat with my mom going through my insurance website to find a Primary Care Physician and a CBT therapist in my plan. (I’m 27 and live across the country from her/them but visiting for the holiday). It was nice to do this and see her support because as a guy I feel like it is hard to open up.

But on the bad end of things - what prompted me to do this was my rising anxiety throughout the week and frequent panic attacks that have been happening. To condense my story, I have had anxiety for awhile, used to go to a therapist but then moved and never got a new one. This year has been a linear ramp up of baseline anxiety with occasional weeks of extremely intense anxiety.

So my hopes are that I can figure something out with these new doctors. Going to start going as soon as I can. My older sister has been telling me that she had been having bad anxiety for the first time ever this year and went to the doctor and got prescribed the lowest dosage of Lexapro (sp?) and she proclaims its helping her immensely.

I’ve never been medicated but I am open to it. My questions for you guys - has anyone found more or less success in medication? Has it ultimately helped or made things worse? Is it really difficult to get off it if you are on it consistently? I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little nervous. I think I want to do what my sister is doing and go on the lowest dosage possible to see what my outcome is and adjust from there. I also plan on going to CBT weekly.

I feel like I want to cut him off but he is such a nice guy and we get along so well, I don't understand why I am so anxious about this. I told him about this problem and he said he understand it and that he does not want to pressure me into a relationship. I feel guilty because I kind of led him on... But if I cut him off everything will probably become worse. I would be so thankfull if I'd talk to someone who feels the same",Today my anxiety was really bad...help,Anxiety,1,e4kmcm,False
t2_251puloy,"TMI but I have a super bad yeast infection. It's causing me so much discomfort. I've been this way for about a month. I was prescribed an anti-fungal pill, but one of the rare but possible side effects is life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm. WTF. Like how do I calm myself down enough to take something that could possibly put you in the hospital? I would take an anti-anxiety med to calm myself, but you absolutely cannot mix it with benzodiazepines. I don't know what to do. I've been crying about this. Please give me some advice.",trouble taking medication that i really NEED,Anxiety,1,e4kv35,False

t2_51lbhku1,"My anxiety is really mild. I never had a panic attack, only anxiety attacks. My worst physical reaction I've ever had was losing the control of my limbs for a few minutes with a harsh heartache, but aside from that day I just have basically 3/4 times a month a mild attack that generally involves light dizziness, lack of breath/choking, chest pain and my heart rate skyrockets for some few minutes.

My insomnia is kinda bad, generally I take 2-3 hours before sleeping for real, but I generally can sleep most of the days. And I can tame really well my social anxiety. I had a Model UN simulation last week and although I felt really bad whenever I was talking, I spoke a fuck ton.

The thing is, I know it's not natural to have the symptoms that I have, so I went to the psychiatrist, but when I tried to talk about what I was feeling, I froze. My mind went like ""All my problems are trivial compared to other people's why tf am I here."" and I ended up talking about generic stuff for 5 minutes or so before ending the session. I never mentioned any anxiety attack, insomnia or something like that. I just left the session and started crying in the bathroom. I feel like I can't ever be helped because I can't let myself be helped.

Fuck, I just wish I could respect my feelings. I know everything that is toxic with my mindset but I can't help myself. I can't talk to anyone in my life about it also because I think they don't care at all about me. And I know they care but I can't trust anyone.

Every time I browse this subreddit people are talking about their small achievements and I realize how my illness is tame. People here literally can't go to the movies alone and I'm complaining about taking a little while to sleep. I also find challenging to go alone, but I mean, I can (I never tried it though, but I'm assuming because I'm that ignorant).

I feel bad for feeling bad when people are going through much worse shit.",I feel like I'm silly for feeling bad.,Anxiety,1,e4l01f,False

t2_48m5dp94,"Someone tell me to get over myself, get back to work and that I have no reason to be a big ball of nerves because I told a coworker (who is still a stranger but have said hi in passing to) I don't want to give them a ride to get food.  She asked what the big deal was and other people have given her a ride. I said I'm not comfortable with people in my car. She asked again and said she'd pay for gas. I said no, I'm not comfortable with it. She said it's just down the road and doesn't understand why I'm making this a big deal. I said i wasn't even sure if my insurance covered her if we got into a car accidents. She was just staring at me. I said I'd check to see if my insurance covers and maybe i could. 


It's fu#$ing ridiculous I'm not saying no and sticking to it and it's ridiculous she isn't just...going away...uuuugh!!! 

The last few days I've been on edge and this isn't helping. 

Please rationalize this for me.",I'm hiding out in the bathroom because I said no to someone (as they persist) and I'm now a big ball of nervousness. Someone kick me in my ass.,Anxiety,1,e4l4kw,False
