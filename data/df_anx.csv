t2_q7kfjlz,"In celebration of 2018 and all the progress I made with depression, I decided 2019 would be dedicated to coping with anxiety. For me, anxiety has always been a more subtle and covert emotion than depression, thus making it harder to deconstruct and work through. When I'm depressed, it's very obvious to me, but when I'm anxious, it can be hard to pinpoint because of how long I've lived with it (it feels normal) and how it tends to hide, expressing itself through other emotions. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, I decided to get to work and start brainstorming the ways I can detect my anxiety and understand what exactly causes it. I've learned that when I want to work on things like anxiety, depression, etc. I have to dig in head-on. This led me to a TED talk by therapist Brene Brown called ""The Power of Vulnerability"" and she discusses her professional and personal findings on shame, fear, guilt, lack of self-confidence, and vulnerability. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, after some soul-searching, I've realized I have a deeply-seated lack of self-confidence and this realization has utterly shaken me to the core. It's as if I've spotlighted anxiety, hiding in the bushes all this time, and by doing so, I've elucidated how much it affects facets of my life. I realize now why I fear relationships (friendly and romantic) and affection, yet deeply long for a partner and feel pain when I see my two closest friends together, dating. I realize how much I place my own self-worth in the hands of others and subsequently, why I struggle to be content in my own company. I realize how much I live off of affirmation from those around me and how truly inferior and lacking I feel to my peers.

&amp;#x200B;

This massive realization has utterly ruined me for the last two days and I just ask for some support, advice, and comforting words please, at least to hold me up until Wednesday, the day of my therapy appointment. I'm experiencing so many emotions at once-- grief, shame, fear. What were once quiet hums have turned into booming, overwhelming thunders and it's so difficult to cope. Every small thought transforms into a giant spiral of negativity and catastrophization. I've had to quit playing Minecraft, a game I find calming and soothing, because simply the \*thought\* of messing up a house and having to start over makes my chest tight. This is hell.

t2_qqcsl,"As the title of this post says, today I've had the epiphany that the whole New Year celebration triggers me. 

It's not the people (I've learned to deal with big social gatherings a long time ago. I even enjoy them, if all the people in the room are from my inner circle). It's not the pyrotechnics or fireworks, I love them actually. It's common to believe that what triggers me is how overwhelming all of it can be, especially since I am diagnosed with Social Anxiety. But no, it's not any of it. 

You see, I have a terrible fear of failure. I always feel like I'm not doing enough. Like I'm wasting time. Work hours are never enough. Hobbies and activities to keep me occupied are never enough. I always have too much free time, no matter how exhausted I feel. 

People wait for the new year in hope of new things, new experiences and with the hope that the year to come will be better than the previous one. The new year is perceived as a new opportunity to start over, to do better, to try again, etc. 

But to me is just a gigantic reminder of how everything I'm doing is not enough, how the time is still passing, not stopping. Another year has gone by and I haven't done enough. And don't be confused, I always have that feeling, those thoughts, in the back of my head, every day. But today, it's insanely intensified, it's burning through every other thought or feeling and I can't seem to ignore it. And I know the change of year is just another date on the calendar, my logical thoughts remind me this. But my anxiety is just standing there, tapping annoyingly on her wrist watch, reminding me: ""tik tok"" and it's so loud. 

Social media only makes it worst. Seeing all the people celebrating and expressing how excited they are to what's to come and stuff like that. I already logged out of everything for today after the first 4 or 5 posts lol.

Bad Things in 2018:

\- My anxiety has reached its worse in my whole life and I had no idea what it was until recently.

\- I had physical issues with my body due to anxiety and it made it worse

\- I have began meditation and my mind has been much more clearer because of it

t2_b4ivy,"I can get really bad anxiety when it comes from girls I like. But what I'm going through is worse than anything I had before.

There was a girl I really liked earlier this year. She means a lot to me and she helped shaped who I am. I fought my anxiety and asked her out. She said no and never said why. I had a hard time taking it because I didn't know why. I couldn't be able to go to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about why she didn't want to go on a date. I would only sleep because of mental exhaustion. I eventually burned my self into depression. At that point it was no longer about this girl, but depression taking over my life. Depression telling me I was  worthless, no one  cared about me, and that I  was going to be alone forever. I almost ended my life. My boss was the only person who checked up on me,even though I didn't tell him what I was going through depression. He used to call me in to work but not to work, just to talk. He helped me get out of depression and told me I have to push her away to heal, and I did that and I got better quick. My boss also helped me in learning how to pick up other girls and I went on a bunch of dates. I feel like I owe him a lot for the advice and helping with my depression. 

When I felt better I brought back the girl again. Initially I thought I could just see her as a friend. I told her why I needed space and time. She understood, she is incredibly nice person. I found out she did like me back but she was scared of commitment at the time. We started to talk and hangout again. Two months go by and I started to like her again.

I was scared to be in the same situation again so I told her I can't be her friend. I told her I can't be her friend because it would kill me if I saw her with someone else and that I don't even want to know if she is talking to someone. I told her I couldn't be in a relationship because it would have been long distance and I would start filling In the blank because of my anxiety. She understood and ended the conversation saying ""you every hear stories of people who are perfect for each other but couldn't be together because of timing and situation, I think that's us"" 

The next week was weird because I kept getting stories upon stories of ""the one who got away"". I've been dating for a couple of months and I didn't like any of them. I think I went on 20+ dates this year and about 6 relationships. One of them cheated on me and no one clicked. I got extremely scared that this girl would be the one who got away, and I at least need to try. So I went to talk to her and that I wanted a date. She used to like me, she said she likes spending time with me and talking to me, she said talking to me was different from anybody else. 

She couldn't go on a date because she was talking to someone she meet in college. She didn't tell me that, because I told her I didn't want to know if she had someone because I would get hurt. I did get hurt. That's why she said ""you ever here stories of people who are perfect for each other, but can't be together because of timing and situation"" She said she almost wants me to wait for her because she does want to try something, but they are committed and she doesn't want to put me in that position. And to be honest I would put myself in that position.

I spent all day at work thinking about what could have happened, what I could have done, if I worked harder to be in same college, the fact that she was scared to commit to me but she can't date me because of commitment, and many more things. We were getting busy at work and my family kept harassing me about something too. My chest hasn't gotten this tight since a long time. I went out to give my therapist a call, but the local business got mad and was yelling at me saying I was smoking and I ruined his lunch (I do smoke but never near his business, trying to quit though) I cracked and I started to have a panic attack. 

My boss stopped the man from yelling at me, told me to take a break, and eventually went to find me to talk to me. He took me to lunch and I explained anxiety to him and depression. And he understands what I'm saying more than my friends or family. He made me realize I was over thinking a lot of this. And I guess yeah I need time to heal but he is putting me on the right path again. 

He is an amazing person. He hired me to be a mechanic even though I didn't know anything about cars and didn't have any tools but I told him I desperately need a job with flexible hours. He motivates me to stay in stay college, even when I wanted to drop multiple times. He hasn't fired me even after the countless times of me fucking up. I'm grateful that he is my boss.

So a little backround, I'm 23 years old. 2 small children. I was a stay at home mom for a portion of the year until recently when I got a job as an expo in a kitchen..about a month ago. I was off Sunday so I decided to go out with my sister for the first time in forever, and have a few drinks. Without delving too much into it, I'm an extremely self-critical person. When alcohol gets involved I am 10x worse. I've had anxiety since I was about 12-13 years old, getting worse and worse over the years. I've had some bad panic attacks before, but today was the absolute worst one I ever experienced. So last night, conversations ran pretty deep and I carried everything into the next day. From subjects of my past and a narcissistist ex, let's just say my mental state of in a bad state of mind. I had work at 4 and was ok until about 20 minutes before I left for work. Me being new, I have some natural anxiety on top of what I was feeling today. 
About 3:30: stood up from the couch to get my shoes on. Hands buzzing, legs wobbly, dizzy. Starting to feel the attack coming on. Rushing out the door. 
3:45: Close to work. Panicking. Making fiance stop car several times because I could not breath. Throat felt closed. Heart racing. Thought I was having a heart attack. Mind knew it was panic, body did not agree. 
3:55: Pulling into work driveway. Made fiance park car. For the first time in my life my stomach felt physically sick from panic attack. Reached for closest thing to puke. Repeating ""I can't do this. I can't go in"" over and over for fiance. 
4:00: Call my best friend. Try to see if she can calm me down. In tears at this point. Heart racing. Sick to stomach and uncomfortable. Starting to feel disassociated. 
4:05: Hubby tells me either call off, go inside and explain, or clock in. Feel Frozen in fear. Afraid managers will think I'm faking it to party for new year's. (Did not drink at ALL tonight. Pledged that I'm never drinking again after today)
4:10: Go in. Host says I look really pale. I'm shaking. Heart still racing. Fighting off urge to faint. I'm now anxious about talking to managers even though they're all nice and understanding. 
I go to the kitchen and the manager sees me and immediatly asks if I'm okay. I explain and get told I have to get a doctor's note or else I'll get points. She's nice about it. My fiance came back and picked me up from work. He was very supportive, but I for some reason couldn't stand the driving motion as it was making me sick and panic. I have never felt like this before. When at home I called my sister and she somehow calmed me completely down from the panic attack. We relieve the babysitter and I go upstairs and lay  in bed and fall asleep for a hours. I still feel panic residue but much better. I have work tomorrow and very much do not want to go. If anyone has had a panic attack of this magnitude, I give you all of my kudos. My anxiety has always been a boulder that weighed on me everyday. Never enough to cause me to miss work. In my 23 years, this has been the worst one.

On the 12th of december i got really sick. I was freezing from head to toe even though i was under all of my blankets. That night i had my first major panic attack in 10 years. It came right as i was about to fall asleep. I suddenly had this feeling of dread like something bad was about to happen. Seconds later I got hit with this wave of what i can only describe as feeling like i was about to die. I started shaking all over and fearing for my life. Not really knowing what to do I took one of my blood pressure pills and chugged a bottle of water and curled up in a fetal position in the shower hoping the hot water would help. About an hour later it had finally subsided and i collapsed on my bed and passed out.

The following day i woke up and my left arm and both of my feet half way up my shins were partially numb. I told my parents and not wanting to be alone i laid down in the living room while my mom was cleaning the house. That afternoon I decided to go to urgent care. The doctor (in short) did an ekg to make sure it wasn't my heart, then had told me i was panicking and he wrote me a prescription for lorazepam. I took 1 a day for the next few days and i was feeling fine.

A week later i have another one right as i was about to pass out again. This time I was thinking i may have had an allergic reaction to some food i ate(grabbing at straws). So i started micromanaging everything i was eating. Making sure not to eat anything that i had eaten the previous times it had happend. I was fine for about another week.

Last Friday. I had one in the middle of work. I hadent eaten anything yet that morning. I grabbed my bottle of water and just walked out of the building and down the road avoiding talking to anyone. I had a few more minor ones before the end of the day and I would go to the bathroom or try to isolate myself some how while they happened. I got home and collapsed in bed.

Saturday was pure hell from the second i woke up. I had 2 major episodes through the day. Then the most intense one I have had happened at ~10 pm. I walked into my parents room shaking and crying saying I need to go to the ER. The entire time I just remember appologizing to them.(r/aww saved my life that night) I had 3 more before before i finally got a room, and then 4 more while I was in the room. The doctor ran a blood panel and did some tests to make sure I wasnt having a heart attack or a stroke. Everything came back negative. he said that lack of sleep could be having this effect on me(all of this in more detail but it was 3am and i havent slept in 19 hours.) I've always had problems sleeping and didnt really think about it. He prescribed me some ambien and a nurse gave me a dose before i left and we went home and i passed out.(not taking the benzo and Ambien at the same time) the Ambien helped with falling asleep but my usual method of visualization to calm down was useless. My mind was just a vomit of everything in my head.

Sunday was the day i felt most insecure about myself. I woke up crying. My mom and my visiting aunt took me out just so i didnt feel alone. We went out for lunch, did some shopping, and went bowling. It was a good morning. I had only had some minor episodes while we were out. I had some major attacks after we had gotten home. My girlfriend came over to be with me(i honestly dont know where i would be without her). Just laying in bed watching youtube videos helping me whenever i had my attacks. I decided I wanted to sleep around 7 so i took one of the Ambien. And she was going to stay with me until i fell asleep. About an hour later I was still awake and then another major attack happens. And it hit me extra hard because i thought the Ambien would sedate me enough to not have one. I spent the next half an hour sitting on the toilet just as a seat trying to grasp what was happening and crying deeply out of insecurity. My loving family and GF were all there supporting me and giving me advice. All the mean while my brain was white noise and couldn't concentrate on a single thing. I decided to take a hot shower and then go to bed. My parents were checking on me all night to make sure how i was doing. I felt like I was tossing and turning all night but my mom said I was sound asleep.

Today i also woke up crying but the attacks have become a lot more mild or sometimes just the build up but never really a full attack. I think the Ambien is helping me get the rest i need.

Future, trying to get a doctor to check me out on NYE has gotten me no success. I go back to work on Wednesday. I'll fight my way through. Im not letting this nightmare of a vacation take me out. 

Tomorrow is a new day, a new year. I want to put this behind me and get my life back.

P.s. Ambien dreams are weird...

t2_u5z3me9,"Hello, I’m a high school student and I have a problem where I’m afraid to consider someone a friend Incase they don’t consider me one.  This can fall into multiple categories. 

1) I just think they don’t consider me a friend and that I am just someone to talk to.

2) I think they secretly make fun of me/hate me

3) they just talk to me out of pity and don’t actually like me.

For example, I have close friends and I sometimes get the idea that they don’t actually like me and they just talk to me because I talk to them. I never know if I am annoying them.

This is a big problem in my life, for it hinders me from asking my friends to go out and do stuff.  It’s was sooooo hard for me to ask two of my best friends (but there it is again where idk if they consider me a best friend) to come to my house for New Years.

First post here. I'm in that place right now where you cant even focus to function properly because of this overwhelmingness. I don't really know what to call it, feels like theres a balloon in my chest. Something just feels to be stuck there and it makes me feel weaker by the minute. 

I live in mycollege dorm alone. I have a flight in 2 days to visit my parents. I do this around 2-3 times a year. Have been doing it for 2 years now. Everytime I have to move, I go through this the last 3 days. I don't know why and I don't know how to deal with it. Ive tried running, being with friends but in the end you cant always have people around you. I even have an exam tomorrow and I cant stop panicking and I cant even concentrate as I just don't have any energy. Is there anything I can do?

Is there anyone who was ever in a similar situation? Anyone else have this feeling? Please I'm desperate to feel like myself. ",Anxiety whenever I'm travelling or moving,Anxiety,1,abguu9,False,"Hi.

I knew tonight (or last night) would be a big deal, good money. All the time leading up to New Years I’ve been debating if I wanted to put myself through it with my anxiety. I’ve been doing OK but what if it was too much on me?

t2_14gtmstb,"2019 is going to be a terrifying year of change for me. 

Im 20 years old and I'm in college. It's been almost a year since I've had a job and I lost all of my friends from narcissistic abuse. Aside from that, I'm in college for a music education, so I can lead worship in church. But i also at one point want to get my doctoral for psychology, and become a clinical psychologist. 

This year terrifying in the context of change. I'm not that bad when it comes to change, and im pretty adaptive with it too. But I'm terrified because getting a job, getting a liscence and eventually taking care of myself is a really hard thing to realize. I can't sleep normally some nights, and I find myself being slumped in bed all day not getting anything done, and feeling even more worthless because I didn't do anything. So I'm in a perpetual cycle of just self loathing and self hatred and laziness. I cant tell if this is depression, or actual laziness. 

Job interviews scare the hell out of me, and I hate phone calls. I used to be better with in in my last job, but long story short i worked with my abusive ex at the time. And she was the one that helped me get the job in the first place. Ive always thought I wouldn't have gotten the job if it wasnt for her. 

I have about a month before I need to get a job, and actually become an independent adult. Im excited for that aspect of it, but everything that comes with constant pressure to perform for superiors and dealing with disagreeable people in the work place, makes me want to cowar in a corner, cry and beg to never leave and to have me shot. 

I don't know if others can relate to this. And I know I'm just trying to make excuses not to work, but working isn't the issue for me... I'm a really hard working person when it comes to giving me a task. Im really quick with it too. But its the process of actually GETTING a job that makes it so fucking horrifying. 

If I don't, I'll most likely have to leave college for a while, and live with my parents up until i actually find a job to work. I feel so useless and worthless, and I just don't know how to get over my anxiety over it all. 

Im sorry for my rant.

I have lived through some of his darker episodes and periods of these illnesses and seen and heard and experienced him doing some crazy, worrying, heartbreaking and infuriating things, and I believe as a result of being subjected to a prolonged and continuous amount of that stuff, it has left me with some mild anxiety issues over the years, however, in the last 6 months, out of nowhere, it has gotten immensely worse, along with my derealization. He has been in a comparatively far more stable state now for the better part of 2 years, but now in recent times, I have this obsessive, frightening, horrible fear that I too will start hearing things that aren't there and basically end up like my dad. It's causing me unbelievable distress and panic, and I'm constantly plagued with this ominous feeling and question the reality of subtle, more quiet noises, in fear that I am imagining them (i.e. little noises, like creaks in the house, high frequencies, etc.).

Can someone please tell me how to stop this ruthless thinking cycle and also explain the chances of (i know this sounds illogical) getting PTSD/schizophrenia if you've had a parent with it?

t2_m3qsp,"I'm curious as to how some of you have effectively treated this. 

I'm wondering if this is simply one single problem or two separate issues. The main problem is severe reoccurring episodes of intense anxiety, severe nausea, intermittent abdominal pain and frequent vomiting. Could be once a year, could be 5 times a year. Symptoms can last a day or several days, leading to restlessness, lack of sleep and dehydration. 

Stress and menses could possibly be a trigger of sorts but otherwise there seems to be no pattern other than a ""feeling"" of an episode coming on followed by a slow build up of symptoms. 

Most oral antiemetics don't work when it becomes a full blown episode and then once the vomiting starts, obviously nothing will stay down. Taking stuff like Zofran, promethazine, Compazine etc may slow down the effect but generally doesn't abort it in severe cases. 

We've basically been to numerous doctors, a GI specialist. Lots of things have been ruled out but there was never a definite diagnosis. Everything is essentially normal medically speaking.

I woke up at about 9 and got very little sleep, I spent that day taking care of my wife trying to make her feel better. I didn't have an appetite the whole day and outside of feeling a bit sleepy I actually felt fine. That night before bed the very same symptoms washed over me and I spent the whole night standing in the kitchen again trying to calm myself down once more. Heart racing, shaking, nauseous, tired. I went to bed around 5am again and again called in sick to work.   


My wife was at this time fully recovered, I hadn't told her what was going on as I didn't want her to worry/think I am weird. When she came down that morning at about 9am to see why I was asleep on the couch I told her I had really bad insomnia and had fallen asleep down there. That night while I felt very nervous about having this happen again I was so tired from lack of sleep that I finally fell asleep at about 9 but I woke up early that morning at about 4am and had to run to the bathroom with horrible diarrhea. After that was done I got worried again and started shaking, I felt like the walls of the house were closing in on me and felt like if I didn't leave the house I was going to be ill. So I went to work very early and told my boss I was just trying to catch up on work that I was behind on from calling in. I lied to my wife and told her that I got an on-call and needed to go in early. (again the thought of her worried about me makes me anxious). I got into my office and much like I would in the kitchen I sat in my office and calmed myself down then felt completely fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

That night rolled around and I started having those extreme feelings of dread wash over me like I was becoming ill again. I had to tell my wife at this point what was going on, so I told her that I just needed to get out of the house for a minute, so I went to Walgreens panicking the whole way there but as soon as I got there I started to feel completely normal. Once I got there I was hoping to buy zzzquil but ended up getting NyQuil to basically force myself to sleep. I took it and fell asleep woke up the next morning feeling GREAT that I had finally gotten a nights sleep.  


Every single day now for going on over a week, I spend the whole day feeling completely fine. As soon as I get home I feel twinges of anxiety but I tell myself if I just take my mind off it I'll be fine so I read and watch TV. Sometimes I'm okay until about 7pm then the very same horrible feelings wash over me, I leave the house and go stand in my office in the middle of the night until I'm calm, then go home drink some NyQuil and go to sleep. Sometimes I'm fine until even later, I wake up at like 2am and start panicking then have to leave the house to calm down at my office some more before going back.  


My wife has been going through a very hard time emotionally with the loss of our pregnancy and being depressed because of work. I want to be able to be there for her, but I spend all night at the office trying to calm down. We went on a date yesterday in hopes that getting out of the house would make me okay and she could tell I was miserable the whole time. This anxiety, wherever it has come from is completely controlling my life. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to look. I'm becoming extremely depressed because I miss my wife, I just want to be able to be home with her in her time of need. The more depressed I get the more anxiety I feel.

I have been diagnosed with GAD. I mostly function well and live a happy life, but when it hits me, it really hits me. I have a panic attack, I break, I cry for hours and sometimes it takes me days to recover. I've already seen three different therapists and none helped me. The only person who has ever understood me is my (long-distance) girlfriend. I felt such a relief when we first started dating, all my problems got so much better. But they were still there and kept showing up and messing things up.
 I'm also just a weak person in general. It takes very little for me to wind up in tears and need her help. And she always helps me. I help her too when she has problems but it's obvious who's stronger and helps who more. I've gotten worse recently and needed help her help more, but whenever I said I felt like I was being selfish she'd say that it was okay and that if I needed help she'd help me, always and that I'd help her whenever I was strong enough to. I've gotten to a point where I can't see her sad or crying without breaking myself, meaning she has to recover herself and then help me and I know that's not fair. 
Well this night she snapped and I don't blame her for a second. I am currently visiting her and staying at her house. We had a small argument, I got anxious, broke, she broke too, I couldn't help her and then after a while she started complaining. She said that she couldn't take it anymore, that I was being selfish and unfair and was expecting too much of her. She got extremely angry at me, kept telling me that I had to find some way to improve myself and to make it up to her tomorrow morning. She told me she was not breaking up with me but she did kick me off of her room by saying ""go away.""
I don't know what to do. I don't know how to fix my problems, it seems like I've tried everything short of medication and nothing works.

I commute to school, 1.5 hours each way. I go to one class where we sit in groups of 4 (my group is 3 girls though) where we do lots of arts and crafts type of activities and after I go to the library to do homework. 

In my class, today we were cutting and pasting things onto a notebook, and the other 2 girls, who sit across from me in a square table, were chatting away together and not involving me in their conversation, a totally natural thing to do, idk they might know each other from other classes or something. 
But no. My anxiety immediately spiked and I became paranoid of everything. 
I became hyperaware of the way they spoke, of the way the other groups interacted, of the way I looked today, and every single word I said since I walked into the class. It was SO bad. I wanted to throw up. 

After the class, I went to the bathroom and cried. I couldn’t hold it in. I cried and cried. But then, I dusted myself off and went to do homework, but I was so anxious still. I felt like there were creepy crawlers all over me. All I have wanted to do all day is crawl into bed and curl up and sleep. 

After wasting some time, I decided to go home. The whole 1.5 hour drive I listened to an audiobook which helped me relax. But once I got home, my boyfriend was filling his taxes and he was getting frustrated and he was raising his voice, not at me, but that is a major trigger for me. I tried to remove myself from the situation but I felt so lonely. 
I have felt so lonely for so long. 

My boyfriend is great, and he cuddled with me a little bit, and then he fell asleep, and I couldn’t. 
I’ve been awake not knowing what to do. I’m so anxious I feel like throwing up. 
I’ve taken a shower, drank water, and listened to relaxing music. 
It’s to the point where I can’t control this anymore. I want to go back on medication but I can’t afford it. 

I’ve been crying for half an hour.

I commute to school, 1.5 hours each way. I go to one class where we sit in groups of 4 (my group is 3 girls though) where we do lots of arts and crafts type of activities and after I go to the library to do homework. 

In my class, today we were cutting and pasting things onto a notebook, and the other 2 girls, who sit across from me in a square table, were chatting away together and not involving me in their conversation, a totally natural thing to do, idk they might know each other from other classes or something. 
But no. My anxiety immediately spiked and I became paranoid of everything.

I have been dealing with depression since 2013 (probably before too). In 2016 when I accepted me as a gay guy things seemed to improve and that same year I got into a relationship. In 2017 I revealed myself to my family. While this relationship lasted I was distracted from the pain, after discovering the various betrayals that destroyed the relationship, it was as if pain had taken center stage in my life again. Now it's been three weeks since I have to look back at my problems and my pain. There is nowhere else to go, what has cheered me for a while in the end was only the springboard to return to the bottom of the pit in the most painful way possible. 

 I have become a broken person, I know that this is just a repertoire for life, an experience common to many other people and that there are people who have bigger problems.  

Anyway the pain does not seem to want to leave, I do not miss the old boyfriend, I do not love him anymore. I miss being happy, I miss loving. I know that I must now build my emotional stability on things that depend only on me, but it is incredible how I am being swallowed up in solitude even though surrounded by an incredible network of support, family, and friends.

 It's time to face the ghosts of the past, to solve my emotional problems, now I'm alone. I will have to sit at the table with my feelings: anguish, pain, lack of self-esteem, anger, frustration, contempt, pessimism, shame, hopelessness, disappointment, discouragement, embarrassment, exhaustion, mourning, guilt, insecurity, loneliness, sadness and boredom

 However I do not feel pessimistic despite all these feelings, I think at the moment are a natural response to the trauma, I am human. Just as my life has been changing radically since 2013 I know that this state of change will continue.

Happy and unhappy at the same time.

While my parents know about the last two, they don't even think that I have anxiety and even if they do, they'll think it's my fault.

So, I've had anxiety ever since high school. It's the kind of anxiety that wanes every now and then, but comes back too. I have panic attacks, but I've almost always kept them hidden so nobody else except ""close friends"" know. I'm scared over the smallest things, like my friends seenzoning me thinking I just fucked up, or my cat being left at home thinking he'll be stolen or something. I feel better when I'm talking to someone about the topic, and while my friends are very helpful, I feel that it would be better if I could talk to my parents about this.

I've told them countless times that I feel this way, but boy, I don't know. Instead of helping me they get pissed. When I try to explain further, they'll pull out the ""I feed and support you so I'm always right"" card. Forcing me to interact among unknown people when I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT, always telling me what to do, taking away my use of tech cause they think it's interfering with my studies and making me an asshole (what?), and so much more. They think I'm entitled and even compare me to the poor kids, but it's a logically flawed comparison. Of course I can't correct them. They think they're so smart they're r/iamverysmart material. I don't know why they're like this, but maybe because I'm actually sociable and nice with my dudes and gals and even a bit naughty, in a non-sexual way of course ;)

Whenever they get angry, they do the typical parent scolding, but this makes me panic a lot of the time. They think me panicking is because I'm an asshole to them, but in fact, it's because I HAVE ANXIETY DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND! 

One time (no, four times actually) I raised my voice, then my dad beat me. I had nothing to do but to block his blows (which he and my mom interpreted as me fighting back). I was suffering a panic attack at that time, and I could not do anything. I just let it happen. Afterwards, deleted all my games (even Discord, which they thought is a game). Big oof to me.

I love my parents, and I know they love me. You may think this is Stockholm Syndrome but no, it's genuine. It's just they're too much.

t2_2mkwfp65,"Hello!

Today my SO and I are going to see their heart doctor and I’m going to attempt talking to them about prescribing anti-anxiety medications. My SO is not diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but... his symptoms are honestly making life very difficult. It feel mean to say that but it’s the honest truth. He keeps having panic attacks so bad he thinks he’s having a heart attack which just makes it worse. It’s often difficult for me to leave the house because he’s so anxious about something happening to me. I need to send several updates and even then he isn’t fully calm until I’ve been home a while. He has so many triggers that he can’t even enjoy what used to be hobbies because small aspects of them (for instance he can’t read what used to be favorite books because of how many pages he has to skip to avoid triggers) send him into panic attacks. 

The problem is that he will 100% refuse therapy. I don’t want to share his personal history but a childhood therapist severely violated his trust. I’m pretty sure if his doctor insists on therapy my SO will start panicking right there. 

So my questions are;

1. Is is going to be weird if I bring this up? My SO suffers from selective mutism and likely won’t be able to talk about it. 

2. How can we refuse therapy without seeming like drug seekers. We’re not necessarily asking for Xanax. He’d actually prefer something to take everyday that prevented the attacks than something that stopped attacks from happening. 

3. Advice on how to talk to the doctor about what is happening without sounding like “boo hoo my life is hard even though they’re the one with the illness.”


Note: posting in a couple subs for extra advice


Thanks for any help!!

I was on medication for two or three years, but decided to drop it, as I felt like it really held me back. A few years later again and I went to university, and held this confident facade quite well. 

Recently, I've started a new class at university, and the majority grade is for a debate.

Right now, I'm on day 3 at a new job (grooming dogs) and the anxiety has returned worse than before. I'm sitting here feeling the tightness in my chest and muscles starting. I quit my last (and best ever) grooming job back in September during a panic episode. 

I take only Xanax, because everything else screws with my body too badly (painful rashes on my face, vomiting, non stop periods, etc). I have a diagnosis of bipolar II as well, which I don't necessarily agree with... But it's in my medical records. 

Anyway, I know a big contributor to this is the involuntary psych watch I was placed on as an 18 year old. I have a huge problem being anywhere that I can't just leave. Jury duty has been another bad trigger in the past, with full on panic attacks in the court room during selection. Twice. 

So, like I said, I groom dogs. I have done this for over 10 years, and I'm very good at the actual grooming part... But I can't deal with the constant  need to meet 2-3 hr turnarounds on live animals. I want to leave the second I walk in the door. I have applied hundreds of times for other jobs in other industries (which I never get hired for and rarely even get an interview for), but even the thought of those causes this same feeling at this point. I have lost or quit every job I've ever held because of panic attacks at work. 

I tried to talk to my GP about this on Tuesday, but she just didn't get it. She rudely brushed it off as I just have to do what I have to do. Even going to see her sparks a panic attack at this point and I was fighting back tears in her office. 

The last time I tried talk therapy, THAT started a panic attack, and an angry one at that... Because I felt like the therapist wasn't willing to actually HEAR me. 

My husband is disabled with a benign brain tumor, so I literally have to get over this and work... Or bills cannot be paid. But even he does not get it. He does not understand how crippling this is. The last few months as a stay at home mom were heaven for me. Hardly any anxiety... Now that I've been forced to return to work or starve, I can barely function in any part of my life because I'm consumed by the anxiety surrounding working. To add to it, this kills my sex drive and then he pressures me for sex, saying he doesn't mean to, but he has needs. I can't meet those needs in this mental state. So now, he is visibly upset and plods around the house putting off angry energy that I pick up on so keenly. And he just doesn't understand why this makes everything a million times worse for me. He has zero ability to empathize. So I have no support. No one understands this. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how long I can force myself to work. It's destroying me.

But I asked a bunch of people what I was supposed to do, and people were recommending me that I should make a contract or make a company. And contracts really scare me. I have written that I have accepted something that I might not know what it will do. 
I asked someone I knew who is a freelancer, and he told me that he manually mails companies a thing. And that’s even worse, since I’m always worried that it will go to the wrong place, or that I wrote something wrong.

I managed to get back home. Finally my boss texted and said ""no worries."" I'm still worried that they think I was a flaky hire.

i submitted my application and was conditionally approved, so i dont need to show proof of income until we move in. 

i paid the security deposit today.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I am supposed to hop on a 8 hour flight in the next few days for a large presentation. Travel and public speaking are two of the things that make me most nervous in life so I knew this was going to be a problem but now I can't avoid it anymore

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I traveled I had what I think was an anxiety attack the day before the flight. I couldn't decide what to pack and ended up sobbing and hyperventilating on the ground.

So I guess I'm afraid that is going to happen again, especially because I have a lot of work I need to be doing at the same time and a presentation.

t2_eyw0p,"TL;DR at the bottom 

So I am a 20 something year old student, and for almost my entire life I've had pretty major anxiety (to me at least) when it comes to relationships with girls. I've never had an issue when it comes to talking to girls when dating isnt on the table, but as soon as I get it into my mind that I'm interested in a girl I tend to freak out. Pathetic, I know. I'm a smart dude (obviously not smart enough to finish college in 4 years) and I'm honestly pretty good at reading signals, too. I've just never been too good at reacting to them properly. Too often I will justify reasons in my head why a girl is not interested in me, in order to both save me from the embarrassment of rejection and pain of severed emotional attachment.

To put things into perspective, a year or so ago I was talking to a girl that I liked and I had asked her out for drinks. She said that she would but she wasnt currently looking for a relationship. I probably should have saved that text and made it my background, but instead I thought, ""ok, shes not interested in me right now. That's fine, I can get to know her, she can get to know me, and we can reevaluate down the road."" We went out multiple times, the conversation was good and we often stayed past closing time just talking. I thought there might be a connection. We kept talking over phones and occasionally I would get flirty photos and videos from her in her underwear. So at this point I thought maybe her perception of me changed, but at the same time, something felt off. Initially I chalked it up to anxiety, but didnt want to force myself onto a girl who didnt want me. I got busy for a few weeks and we stopped talking for a bit, and out of the blue she sends me a text that says ""what would you think if a girl you liked who you havent talked to in a while sent a message that said 'I miss you'."" At this point I thought for sure she was talking about me, so I told her I'd be pretty damn excited. But instead of saying 'I miss you', she replies with ""i dont know, it's kind of complicated."" So I left it at that. A few weeks later she hits me up and says she wants to catch up and get coffee, so I go and it ends up turning into bowling, drinks, and ice cream, all in that one night. The entire time, I'm sold that she is into me, but I'm so anxious and dont know what to do that I begin questioning every reason I think shes into me. At this point we're in her car with ice cream, so I confront her about how I'm feeling unsure about the signals shes sending and she physically cringes and says to me ""maybe if things were different."" Come to find out, the guy she wanted to text ""I miss you"" too was a buddy of mine that I had figured she was interested in before we started talking. The entire time I had talked to her, beyond the snaps, the videos, her inviting me over to her house and answering the door in jeans and a bra and then being cold and distant the entire evening as we watched a movie, there was always something in the back of my mind that made me freak out and assume she wasnt interested, and everytime I chalked it up to my anxiety.

You could call me an idiot for thinking something might happen between us, or even a pussy for not ignoring my anxiety and going for it in the moments. Either answer could be right, and honestly I dont even know anymore, the whole experience has fucked with my head.

The reason I tell that whole story is because I'm currently talking to a girl who I find to be funny, cute, and smart, and she and I have a ton in common. We have the same class and often study together. First it was as a group, but then she and I started meeting separately. She seems interested in me and we've made plans to do some of the things we both like together, and my best friend is convinced shes into me. But I still have this nervous anxiety that points out to me all the reasons she might not be interested. For starters, when we text, she doesnt always reply to my messages and there is usually a decent amount of time between messages, but when we are studying she is pretty quick to respond to her messages within minutes. There are other clues that make me think she isnt interested but that's a big one for me.

I think I like this girl, and I dont want to give up on another possible relationship because of what I think the other person is feeling. But most importantly I'm just tired of feeling paranoid and anxious when it comes to this shit. I'm really sorry for the huge message and maybe this isnt the place to post this, but I need help. My relational anxiety is tearing my life apart and keeps me from building any kind of serious relationship and I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like when I talk to my friends, they only tell me to stop thinking about it so much, which just makes me think about it more.

If anyone has advice on what to do about this situation, techniques on how to handle my anxiety when I start feeling the way I do when I convince myself that no one is interested in me, or even if you just want to send me dog pictures I would greatly appreciate it. I'm having a hard time coping with it all right now.

I don’t know what generally triggers other people, but if any type of verbal abuse or mention of anxiety + symptoms of anxiety triggers you, then you should be wary. 

I posted this in another community, but it was locked because I apparently broke one of the rules. The comments were deleted, so I’m hoping I could get some suggestions over here.

The Incident: (sorry for the long description) 

I used to work in a furniture store. Anyone who has worked in customer service understands that this industry sucks. I was extremely lucky, however, because I found a store that I actually enjoyed working in. This was mostly because of my amazing co-workers and managers. The majority of the customers were kind, and I don't know, I just enjoyed working there... until I encountered this one customer who I will refer to as Mary from now on.

Like a lot of our customers, Mary is a middle-aged white woman. She was waiting in line and was the only person waiting. My co-worker was helping someone at her till, and I was taking a quick ten-second break because I was feeling ill that day. I quickly noticed that Mary was getting agitated and giving me dirty looks, so I figured she was in a hurry. I opened my till and called her over to help. Here is how the interaction went:

Me: Hi, I can help you over here.

Mary: *walks over to the till* You don’t look like you want to help me.

Me: *slightly taken aback and confused* Oh, I’m not feeling well. I’m sick.

Mary: *getting aggressive* You don’t look like you want to help me. You don’t look like you want to be here. You’re daydreaming. I hope they send you home!

Me: *shocked and speechless* ... *continues scanning her stuff*

I honestly didn’t know what to say to that. I was sooo overwhelmed because she accused me of a bunch of things and was so aggressive. 

Mary: *even more aggressive* You don’t look like you want to help me. You don’t look like you want to be here. You’re daydreaming. I hope they send you home!

Me: *still shocked* ... *scanning her stuff in silence.*

Mary: *even MORE aggressive AND now pointing her finger in my face* You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home!

Me: *managing to scramble enough words* Well, actually, they won’t send me home. My co-worker is going home soon, and I’m the only one here to close.

Of course, that made her even angrier.

Mary: *even MORE aggressive AND repeatedly pointing her finger in my face* You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home! You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home.

Me: *quietly scanning her stuff* ... The only time I uttered another word to her was when I told her the total. She kept screaming at me throughout the entire interaction.

Mary: *Starts leaving, but then turns around and points at me* I hope they send you home!

I honestly didn't know how to react to that. I was genuinely in shock and a bit shaken by the entire interaction. By the end of my shift, I've managed to forget about her. After two weeks, however, I randomly started having vivid flashbacks of the incident. Repeatedly reliving the incident caused my anxiety at work to skyrocket. I was terrified of returning to work. I started having flashbacks every single day. I became depressed. Eventually, I started drinking and smoking to suppress the flashbacks. To this day, I am still experiencing these flashbacks and panic attacks.

Initially, I didn't report this or talked to anyone about it, because I thought I was overreacting. I was also embarrassed because I couldn't defend myself. I just froze up as she hurled abuse at me and I took it like an idiot. What made it worse was that there were people there who witnessed how distressed I was and didn't even bother to tell her to chill or something. I truly regret not kicking her out or calling for a manager, but because I wasn't in the right mental state to deal with that stress, I struggled to process everything that was happening at the moment.

I quit my job in May if that year (2018), and haven’t worked ever since. I’m not in school either. I just stay at home wasting my life away. In July, I visited my family doctor, and she prescribed some medications to help. It has done nothing for me. I still experience these flashbacks and panic attacks. Therapy didn't help either. I don't know what to do. A part of me is terrified of working in a customer service environment again, but that's all I have experience in. I don’t why this incident has affected me this much, and I just want to live a normal life again. What should I do?!

I'm an introvert and never invite people, even close friends, because I feel easily ""invaded"" and uncomfortable. It's like my house is my lair, my nest, the place I recharge and can be alone and relaxed. It feels like it's an extension of my mind, and if people get inside, they will ""get inside me"" (yes, I know, quite illogical but...). I live with my 10-year partner, but he's the exception to the rule. Sometimes a friend of his will stay the night in our spare room, but we usually go out for dinner and they are just here to sleep so I'm not too disturbed. 

My family stayed for 3,5 hours and I was tired and a bit relieved when they left : I had a good time with them, and it was good to see I could stand to have people over for a few hours, but after 2,5/3 hours I felt saturated. The following day I felt drained and blah, but after that I've been feeling my anxiety rise up. 

I'm on Zoloft and assorted medication for GAD, and have been doing better for the last few weeks, but it feels like a setback now.

Even though I know it's improbable, they don't usually act like that.

t2_4mbw6du,"Hi everyone!

Unfortunately my anxiety is expressed in physical symptoms. I find difficulty in taking deep breaths. I really feel super tight in my lower back and it keeps me from taking deep satisfying breaths. I’m pretty sure that this is because of the tension I carry in my back. 

Anyway, I’m super aware of my breathing and I can’t breathe right. People recommended diaphragmatic breathing but breathing in my chest feels better and satisfies more my air hunger. 

I’m always hungry for air. The problem is that it’s a daily thing and stays with me all day. I’ve been to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist. Had an ECG, EKG and Xray done on me and nothing turned up. Been told it’s anxiety, which I’ve had for 6 years now, I’m 24.

Has anyone gone through this before, I’ve been like this for 4 years now.

t2_3bnjbir5,"Well hey everyone. I'm posting this with a throwaway account because I feel terribly ashamed and helpless, and I need some advice. 

A few things about myself... I'm in my 20s now and I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Even as a child, I used be super anxious. I'd always have some sort of tight knot in my stomach. I tried talking to my mom about this once, she told me I was too sensitive. I remember a time where it got so bad that I'd wake up with that feeling, and all I could do was cry. Things like taking a shower or buying groceries were an accomplishment. It took half a year until I felt better again. Generally I'd say that it's fluctuating. Some days I'm not very anxious at all, then the next day I have a flare up and spend my night crying. There is no fixed pattern. Although I can say that things get even worse during the winter months. 

I have troubles dealing with my emotions in general. I do feel, I actually feel a lot. I may not have many friends, but I care deeply about them. I am here for them to listen, I give advice, I care and help as much as I can. However it seems that I can't do the same for myself. I can help others but never myself. 

Other than that, I tend to bottle up everything I feel. I worry too much, I immediately imagine the worst possible outcome. If I fall in love, I think of all the reasons why it's not going to work out. Someone is not texting back, or texting me in a slightly different way than usual? They must hate me. Should I text first? What if that annoys them, what if they don't want to talk to me? Do they even care about what I have to say? These are my unsleeping ever-pacing thoughts, they keep on racing in my mind, and I can't seem to break out of this mindset once I started. I think I am incredibly scared of being left alone, of being abandoned. 

Now, about my current situation. I completed my degree recently. Ever since then I've been feeling down. The burning passion that I had since I started is gone. I always put 100% percent in my work. For my thesis I couldn't. I sat at my desk for hours but never wrote anything down because I knew it wouldn't be perfect. I wrote countless to-do lists and never went through with any of them. I couldn't, I simply didn't have the energy. I was (and still am to a certain extent) constantly tired, I feel burnt out. Sometimes I wake up and feel like I didn't sleep at all. It's almost like there is some sort of veil/fog around my brain that prevents me from thinking and seeing things clearly. And although I passed all my exams in the end, I can't help but feel like an utter failure. 

Eventually I had a session with a psychologist. Apparently I needed to rest, she recommended 3 months. I didn't, my parents made me send applications and now I have a job. It's at a company with a good reputation. They pay very well. They want to send me abroad for a couple of months. Everyone is impressed and congratulates me. I should be happy. But I don't know if that's what I want. I feel uncomfortable, I am hesitating. It's a great opportunity for sure but my dream was it to go back to uni and to become a professor. If I take the offer from my company and go abroad, people will expect me to stay. I might never go back to uni at all. If I do go to uni, I might miss out on a great career and disappoint those around me. Or I fail and never achieve my goal after all. Then I'll wish that I would've accepted the position abroad. 

Here anxiety just completely messes me up. I am scared of making the wrong decision. Or, let's face it: any decision at all. It could be the wrong one, and I might end up regretting it. For a very long time, decisions were made for me. What I wanted was never really important. I avoid making decisions at all costs, it just scares me so much. Unless I am really passionate about a thing, I'd rather choose something that I don't really want to just to please someone else. I depend on the approval of others because I don't approve myself. 
Now I come home from work, I eat, I play video games, then I go sleep. Rinse, repeat. That distracts me from the anguish I feel, I can avoid responsibility. Ultimately I feel that regardless what decision I make, I will always fail. I will never accomplish anything in my life. I will never be good enough.


My apologies for the long read. Any advice on how to cope with these issues in a healthy way would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time. 

","Mental health, anxiety, exhaustion - I need help.",Anxiety,1,aw4f77,False,"Well hey everyone. I'm posting this with a throwaway account because I feel terribly ashamed and helpless, and I need some advice. 

A few things about myself... I'm in my 20s now and I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Even as a child, I used be super anxious. I'd always have some sort of tight knot in my stomach. I tried talking to my mom about this once, she told me I was too sensitive. I remember a time where it got so bad that I'd wake up with that feeling, and all I could do was cry. Things like taking a shower or buying groceries were an accomplishment. It took half a year until I felt better again. Generally I'd say that it's fluctuating. Some days I'm not very anxious at all, then the next day I have a flare up and spend my night crying. There is no fixed pattern. Although I can say that things get even worse during the winter months.

Backstory: I've been dealing with anxiety for 8 years now., and I've kept it to myself. When I turned 20, my cousin passed away and my anxiety/depression was in the most terrible place it had ever been, and I had decided to end my life. My mum happened to intervene (unknowingly) by asking me if I was ok. I broke down then, and told her I feel anxious/scared all the time, but I couldn't really say much more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Its been two years since then, and I still have suicidal thoughts now and then. I've made baby steps with my anxiety, by going to the gym regularly, going to stores and buying shit, I've even gone out to concerts and music festivals. These are huge things for me as before I couldn't even leave my house I was that paralysed by fear. However, its not enough for me. I haven't had a job for years as I get too anxious, I can't take phone calls, I can't go out on a whim, I literally have no friends as my anxiety has caused me to push them all away. I can't get on with my life!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I was always a very independent person, and the past 3 years have turned me into a shell of what I once was. I resent letting myself get this way, I hate who I've become. I know I need help, but I refuse to get it. Sometimes I feel I don't deserve it because I've fucked up my life by letting it get this bad.

Its my goal this year for things to change (even just a little) I'm forcing myself to attend acting classes in June, but I want to seek help from a therapist as well.

I'm also a single mother with a seriously crazy ex and his family driving me up the wall. Not exactly a situation that's even remotely stress free...

Either way, I've had a few issues sending my little one to nursery. It's literally across the road, I can see it from my living room window, but there are days when I have to force myself to go out and drop her off. I've been generally fine and the ladies there know I have a few issues and have been very accommodating. 

Today I messed up.

I woke up at 5am and just knew. Yesterday had been fantastic! I went to the shops by myself whilst the wee one was at nursery, bought myself nice things, got the food in, even had tea in a cafe where my friend works so I could get her to serve me and not one of the random members of staff.

And then today.

I just knew today was going to be bad. I wasn't going to be able to go out today, not even across the road. Did I overwhelm myself yesterday or something? I felt fine, nothing bad happened, I felt... normal, happy even.

So I called the nursery and made up some excuse so that I didn't have to take my daughter to the nursery. I knew I shouldn't have done it. They know I have issues, I know that they know, I should have just said, I'm having a bad day, we won't be coming today, and they would have understood and accepted it. I guess they must have thought something was off because they called my mother to make sure I was okay, and then she called me.

Needless to say, it was a stupid thing to do, and I don't even know why I did it. 

Then I almost had a panic attack because I couldn't get my mother to text me back. She said she'd deal with it, but after nearly 20 mins of waiting for a reply, I could feel my body starting to freak out. I couldn't breath right, I was crying, my hands were shaking so I could barely type to ask her to contact me asap.

I know it was my own fault and I just caused a bigger problem for myself, this is the worst day I've had in a while, I don't even know what I was thinking.

t2_1sv3x7s8,"Hello Reddit users, I hope you are doing well today. Reason I created this topic was to hear if any of you have any advice for me.

About two weeks ago I told my doctor I wanted to stop using SRRI's because I felt that I was in a much better place mentally than before I started using them (6 years ago). My struggles recently have been more about motivation and less about the severe depression and social anxiety I was experiencing before. The doctor agreed that it was a good idea, he actually proposed it first some months ago.

So his initial tapering down plan was to start taking 10mg daily instead of 20mg but he couldn't find a way to order a recipe for 10mg capsules in my country, so he said ""Well then you should just stop at once boom"". He said he didn't think I would feel anymore side effects than I was already feeling from having switched from a SNRI and then back to SSRI. I had been feeling vertigo, increased anxiety. I thought I could give his cold turkey plan a try for some time. I had tried tapering down some years ago by taking every 2nd, 3rd day and so on for some months but went back on full dose when I felt the vertigo and increased anxiety after about two weeks. However I was also more sensitive back then and I didn't have the support network I have today.

I have been completely of SSRI for two weeks now. The vertigo has increased but I can work with it. My mood has been varying a lot. I can feel like crying much easier now when I hear a sad song, but I can laugh and have a good time when I am with friends. My sense of reality I feel is slightly changing, it is hard to describe. I would describe it as the background feeling of being alive, like a base anxiety or something like that. I feel more aware but also more anxious. Like I am slowly being sucked into a state of more awareness. I think it makes my tinnitus more noticeable.

I think I will continue not taking any SSRI for at least two more weeks, that is when my doctor will check up on me. I was surprised he didn't propose taking a 20mg capsule every other day when he couldn't find the 10mg capsules. Instead he just gave me the plan to stop immediately. My impression of him has been good, he seems full of knowledge and is helpful and listens.

t2_xncne,"It was a reflective essay, so I decided to talk about stigma surrounding mental health. It was last second, since I procrastinated it (as one does). I wrote about my struggle with my anxiety disorders, how it got so severe that I ended up in a psychiatric ward, and how what I've experienced (and still experience) doesn't make me any less human. I thought it was messy, and I didn't even bother reading over if because it was such a hard thing to talk about. It was only supposed to be a rough draft. 

I genuinely enjoy being in this class. I am always happy to participate, and the professor makes me feel engaged in the class. So it meant a lot when she pulled me aside after class to tell me it was brilliantly written, she has been through what I have, put everything surrounding my point together brilliantly, and someone would never guess that someone who participates and is as bright as I am struggles with such a thing. She thought it was so great that she asked if I ever considered becoming an advocate. She flat out gave me an A on what I figured was simply an unorganized rough draft with some decent points.

Something I threw together without even proofreading, and just figured out as I went along, impressed someone who truly inspires me to want to learn and be better. It made my entire week, and it made me realize the good I can pull out of even the worst situations. I don't think I can adequately put into words how much what she had to say meant to me. 

In August, I put off going to college because of my mental health. Now I'm going and I'm persevering because of my willingness to learn and reflect on what's happened to me. I believe she mentioned how tough something like that is, and I pointed out that I don't think I would be the empathetic person I am today if it wasn't for everything I've been through. I wouldn't have wrote what I did, I wouldn't have realized how important it is, and I would not have understood how I can experience the *worst* things I have ever felt, but use that to relate to and help people.

t2_k1k2nnv,"Hi All, first time posting here but here goes.

I moved in with my boyfriend about 6 months ago into a shared household. He's been there about a year. Our relationship with the other housemates (2M 1F) has been mixed, but overall amicable. That being said, there are enough issues for us to realise that it's probably best for us to have our own space at this point, and luckily we can afford it. 
Here's when the good old anxiety kicks in for me. Between us, we rent two of the four bedrooms and therefore pay half the rent. We have a 1 month notice policy and sublet from them. Even though I objectively know that it's entirely within our right to give our one month notice whenever we want, I can't help but feel guilt about it. The anxiety in my head is going wild worrying about leaving them with half the rent to pay, the fact that I've only been there for six months and the prospect of potentially have four weeks of really awkward interactions. 
I don't think this is spurred on by nothing though. The last guy who moved out was ripped to shreds for not giving them notice (despite giving them a month) and the housemates themselves don't have a lot of money. They have a tendency to take their frustrations out on us sometimes about ridiculous things which I can go over in more detail if people require.
For more context, I'm a student and we have to move out in August anyway, so I'm anxious to move while prices are low and properties are still available. There are many reasons why it would be good for us to leave now. 

Please give me reassurance that I'm not being an asshole and it will all be okay. Any tips to help break the news in the most amicable way possible would be fantastic too.

Here's when the good old anxiety kicks in for me. Between us, we rent two of the four bedrooms and therefore pay half the rent. We have a 1 month notice policy and sublet from them. Even though I objectively know that it's entirely within our right to give our one month notice whenever we want, I can't help but feel guilt about it. The anxiety in my head is going wild worrying about leaving them with half the rent to pay, the fact that I've only been there for six months and the prospect of potentially have four weeks of really awkward interactions. 
I don't think this is spurred on by nothing though. The last guy who moved out was ripped to shreds for not giving them notice (despite giving them a month) and the housemates themselves don't have a lot of money. They have a tendency to take their frustrations out on us sometimes about ridiculous things which I can go over in more detail if people require.
For more context, I'm a student and we have to move out in August anyway, so I'm anxious to move while prices are low and properties are still available. There are many reasons why it would be good for us to leave now. 

Please give me reassurance that I'm not being an asshole and it will all be okay. Any tips to help break the news in the most amicable way possible would be fantastic too. Thank you everyone. Moving out and terrified of telling housemates",321,7,328,0.122,0.766,0.112,0.2757
t2_177ozt,"Hey everyone, I recently went through some horrific experiences with anxiety and I'm finally at a place where I can mostly manage it. I wanted to share a little bit of my experience.
In October I had my first panic attack. I was hanging out with my SO and all of a sudden I felt like I was going to die. I'm 20 years old, and while I've had my fair share of social anxiety the feeling of an anxiety attack was foreign to me, so I was terrified. I thought I needed to go to the hospital, but I ended up just pacing around my house until 3 AM, where I was finally exhausted enough to crash. I woke up the next morning okay, but confused about the situation. I thought maybe it was a one time thing, and tried to move on.

About a month later I'm walking around with my SO and experience the symptoms again. Heart racing, feeling like I can't breathe, stuck in a negative thought loop of hell, etc. I ended up asking to play cards with him to calm down, and we did for about 3 hours until I was able to breathe normally. This is when I knew I needed help. I ordered a CBT book online and tried to move on.
I started following the CBT book, which is a 7-week program designed to help you change your behaviors and reactions to negative thoughts. All was well for about a week, until I pushed myself with two cups of coffee instead of one. I was thrown into a terrible panic attack right before I had to leave for school. I was stuck in this phase for about 3 days, couldn't eat, felt sick, thought I was going to die, and honestly, getting severely depressed at this point. I had goals, a future, school to do. How was I supposed to do any of it when I couldn't function? I felt hopeless, so I made an appointment with a therapist and GP.
In the next weeks I experienced some new and terrifying thoughts and feelings. I had major intrusive thoughts about health anxiety, violence (terrified I was going to ""go crazy"" from a panic attack), scared I was going to lose my mind in other ways, etc.

At this point in the story, I'll go over how I started to manage my anxiety. These are tips I learned in order.

1.	Exercise. Everyone knows this, but it is scientifically proven to be one of the best things you can do. You'll force your brain to make the right chemicals for mood improvement.
2.	Sleep. Focusing on this helped me tremendously.
3.	Medication. Now while I'm not a huge fan of daily medication, I still wanted to take something. I opted for an ""as-needed"" medication. I took them for the first 3 days, once a day, and I felt so much better. I stabilized after a couple days and have only needed them about 3 times in the past 5 months. If I ever feel the need to take SSRIs, I will. But it was important for me to try to manage things on my own.
4.	CBT Book or Program. If anyone wants to know which one I used, let me know. This was a good resource for identifying thought patterns, making actionable changes, and recognizing that a lot of people have the same exact irrational thoughts you do. Ultimately, this made me feel less alone and like I was actively helping myself change.
5.	Quit caffeine. Again, this one everyone knows. But I had to quit caffeine for a solid 3 months (after drinking multiple cups of coffee every day for 6 years). I'm just now okay with drinking coffee again, but I make it half-caff just to be safe, I don't want to trigger myself into a panic attack again. 
6.	Therapy. Just going has done a lot for my mental health. When I went to my first session, all I could do was cry. She listed to me and understood everything. I went frequently at first, and when I showed signs of improvement I stopped going as often. But always go at your own pace. 
7.	Tracking My Mood. I started tracking my mood daily, and it really put in to perspective how often I let one bad day ruin the rest of the week. Also, when you have a bad day it helps you remember it’s not always going to be like that. I use the app Daylio for this. 


The Good. 
Believe it or not, I think a few good things came out of this experience, and I would like to share them. 

Perspective shift. This experience really put into perspective how awful poor mental health is. I dealt with a bit of anxiety and depression before, but never that bad. I’m now able to empathize with people a lot more. 

More Stable Mood. I used to just go through these periods of highs and lows. After implementing these strategies, I would say much baseline is neutral/good with a few iffy or bad days here and there. 

Effort in Relationships. I’ve put a lot more effort into my relationships. When I was struggling, I couldn’t bare doing anything alone. I was suffering, and I honestly wanted comfort. I reached out to people more during my hardship and made new friends. 

Health Improvement. Due to the fact exercise and proper sleep is proven to improve mental health, my overall health has improved as well. I used to rarely go out of my way to workout, but I must now, especially if I want to feel “normal”. 

Thanks for reading, I really do hope this might help someone. Also, if anyone wants to ask a question or just talk, feel free to DM.

I asked if he wanted to meetup today. At first he tought I was at work but I told him that I could meet him after.

t2_1ops65f6,"This girl is a ray of sunshine. She has one of the most purest souls I’ve ever witnessed. But she suffers from anxiety. Like the always there, constant state of anxiety. Personally, I’ve had my fair share with being anxious but I’m okay at controlling it and I’ve been helping friends with it for over 5 years, so I’m used to it. I’m just looking for suggestions to help her out some. Make her day better. I would go into her backstory but it’s not my place. I’ll just say that she’s had a terrible boyfriend before me (about two years ago) and a realllyyyyy bad experience with what used to be her favorite teacher. She deserves to be happy and filled with joy. She does not deserve the thoughts she has. She does not deserve what she’s going through right now. She really is angelic. 

So I guess my questions are: what do you wish your SO/loved ones did for you when you dealt with constant anxiety? Should I be like “kick anxieties ass today!” or not even bring it up and just try to make her laugh and try to be an escape? Sometimes she tells me to tell her to stop being a little bitch (she calls it tough love) but it just doesn’t feel right for me to do that. 

She says once she graduates HS it’ll be better but I’m worried that it will follow her. She is meeting with a therapist for the first time later today but she isn’t very optimistic about it. She’s worried that it’s wasting her parents money and it won’t change anything. 

Any suggestions will be useful. Thank you for taking time to read this.

t2_2vwo7vdy,"Hi everyone! So...I’m trying to write this as coherently as I can, and I hope it all makes sense lol. They’re all undiagnosed, but I know I have generalized/social anxiety and OCD. My mind constantly runs amok, and I fear the worst will happen, to the point of exhaustion, especially about things like social interactions, even just run of the mill stuff. My body is always so tense, my heart rate is always so fast, I’m tired so often, and I’m taking nexium everyday for heartburn. Also, I think my hair is falling out more often than usual, which is an indication of severe anxiety, I think. Overall, I just feel very stuck, like everything seems so hard. 

I’m a college senior set to graduate in a few months, and I just...haven’t been looking for jobs or internships or anything because the prospect of interviews really scares me, like I can foresee me messing up horribly. Over winter break, my parents started nudging me along in regards to potential jobs/internships, like suggesting I apply for this and that, and I would kind of start to avoid them because all that just scares me. They then told me they didn’t understand why I was so resistant to talking about after college stuff, so I kind of broke down and told them that I’m afraid of interviews and working with people! I told them I get so anxious about things, and sometimes I feel very sad about how anxious I get. And they seemed to understand. My mom said “Well, maybe you need to talk to someone”, like therapy. The concept of therapy kinda scares me, but I know it would make me feel better. My dad was really sympathetic and said that it’s okay that I don’t know what to do in regards to after college stuff, and that I’ll figure it out. All in all, at the end of winter break, I felt better because I told them about how I was feeling. I guess I had this idea that after graduation, I could go to therapy and figure things out from there. We didn’t really talk about me having anxiety though after that; I think we just didn’t want to address it? Idk

But then I came home for spring break and my mom starts asking me about jobs and stuff. I was taken off guard and said “oh I thought we said I could talk to someone first...” and she said something like “is it really that bad? I get anxious too. Everyone gets stressed out sometimes.” My mom has always been saying stuff like that when I try to bring up anxiety—that everyone gets nervous, it’ll pass. She attributes my bad anxiety and heartburn to me working on my senior thesis, and that when I’m done with it, I’ll feel better. Sure, thesis writing has exacerbated my anxiety, but it’s by no means the only cause. I just don’t know how to make them understand that I have a disorder. I’m also kind of ashamed that I have bad anxiety, that it ruins relationships for me, and that I’m really lonely sometimes because of it. Overall, it’s really frustrating, and I just feel so stuck. 

My parents are the best parents in the world, and I’m grateful that they want to help me in regards to after school plans. I also realize that their alarm towards me not actively looking for jobs is more that justifiable. I just wish I could make them understand easier. Sorry this is so long, but this is really the first time I’ve went in depth with how I’ve been feeling. Any advice is much appreciated.

Ok so this is going to be a long post

I'm a 20 year old Male and I have bad anxiety 
Let's start from the beginning all through my school and college years I have had really bad social anxiety and didnt even realise until it was too late and now I have no one. When I was at college I would be so self conscious when I was doing my work I would never ask for help and would always turn the screen brightness down and angle my laptop so no one could see what I was doing even though I knew no one was watching and when someone was watching i would just completely stop working until they were gone. 
I hate talking about my self and my emotions in fact i hate talking to anyone about anything because i always overthink it and end up saying nothing and not contributing to a conversation. This is often misleading to most people who dont understand me as they just think I'm not interested and have nothing to say when really I have so much to say but by the time I finished going over it in my head it's too late and everyone has moved on. This makes every interaction really awkward especially if it's only me and one other person .
There are a few friends that I feel more comfortable around and will at least engage in a conversation with them however lately most of these people have moved on. So now how am I supposed to meet new people when the few people i feel comfortable around no longer bother with me.
I have only ever discussed my anxiety with one person and only talked about it because he bought it up its like no one else even knows I have anxiety which makes it even more uncomfortable for me.

Lately I've been trying to reach out more but everyone seems to always be busy and I dont want to sound to pushy or desperate so I usually just leave it. I will start typing a message to someone but won't actually send it because I overthink it and even when I am sending a message reaching out to someone I will be going over every word so many times even to the point where one word wont sound right in my head then I will Google the word to make sure it's right even tho I known the whole time  it's right. And it doesn't stop there even after I have sent a message or said something to someone I will be thinking it over in my head. 

After I post this I'm going to be going over it in my head for so long even though I know that it doesn't matter and that no one reading this will care

There is so much more I need to talk about but at the moment its 5am and I need to get some sleep

t2_mxjap,"Hey all! 

So I’ve had lifelong anxiety, got much better for a while without medication (not fully but no panic attacks for like 3-4 years except for rarely) and now in the past 6 months got worse again. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg which I have been taking for around 4 months now. I also have Xanax as needed. 

My question is about my boyfriend. We have been together for a couple years, and when we first met and for the first year of our relationship I was still in my “lower anxiety” phase. But then in October / November of 2018 I started having daily panic attacks again  and derealization / depersonalization again. After taking the lexapro, it has gotten better but is still pretty bad. And I can tell my boyfriend is pretty upset about it. He hasn’t ever liked it but when it first started happening he was more empathetic and trying to be understanding and worried for me. Now that it has gone on for so long I can tell he’s getting upset at me. He knows it’s something that is extremely hard for me to control, but he said to me today “I just want happy times” and when I asked him to clarify he said it just seems like I can’t ever enjoy anything because of my anxiety (which is true and literally one of my fears— that I will be so scared to live that I wont). 

For example, yesterday was really hard for me but I pushed myself and we went out to a little festival and rode those electric scooters. I really didn’t want to go because of my anxiety, but super glad I went because it was fun and I pushed through! However today, for him he brought up How anxious I was and how I wanted to leave like 20 minutes into us being there. Which I had told him I was feeling anxious and wanting to leave but that I didn’t actually want to and wanted to push through, the wanting to leave was just my anxiety. But based on what he said, he didn’t have as much fun as I did and actually I held him back from having as much fun as he could have. And over time I have seen how I do that because of my anxiety. Even a trip to the mall can sometimes be a hassle because I’m freaking out inside (but I’ll tell him).

So I’m just feeling super down and not sure what to do because I know my anxiety is pushing my boyfriend away but I can’t just get rid of it... although I want it to be gone and I’m trying. What can I do to make him happier? Should I refrain from telling him about my anxiety anymore? And just try to keep it to myself? I don’t want to hold him back from living his life and enjoying it to its fullest especially since he doesn’t have anxiety but I want to also experience things with him i just have such a hard time.

I'm not sure how common it is for other people, but I have been fainting several times a day over the past week. I have had this issue before, in times of great stress. (ie moving, car accident, loss/gain of employment, etc)

 Months ago, I had to leave work because I was extremely close to fainting and worried I was becoming bradycardic or having some other issue with my heart. I noticed that my heart rate went from low (53bpm was the lowest) to high (85 bpm) when I was usually around 60 - 65. My manager insisted that I went to the hospital or went home.

 My mom was near by so she picked me up and took me. They told me that there was nothing wrong with my heart but it was good that I came in since I took beta blockers for heart palpitations do to anxiety. I struggled for the next few weeks because I still felt faint. 

Then, only a couple months later my boyfriend was in a car accident. I wouldn't walk for 2-3 weeks. I was fainting again. I would sleep for 10+ hours a day for the first week. I went back to a doctor to make sure I was okay. They said i was medically fine. After about a month I was walking again, but had to work part time instead of full time. 

Now, we moved, I started a new medication and was laid off. I faint 3+ times a day if I do anything that remotely causes anxiety. So if I need to leave the house, you can bet that I'm going to faint. I'm sure you can imagine why this makes life difficult. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, is there anything that can help with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Use a technique called semantic conversion. It’s pretty straightforward and useful in social and office settings.  
Social anxiety has a powerful core colored by the fear of being judged by others.

This manifests in all kinds of thoughts and an anxiety action-reaction. I say action-reaction because thoughts can cause anxiety and anxiety can cause unnecessary thoughts. In fact, at times, the two are just one homogeneous blob of discomfort.

Semantic conversion has 2 steps which handle the feedback system of thoughts and physical anxiety as well as behaviors such as social avoidance.  
Step 1: Mindfulness labeling  
Step 2: Constructive rephrasing

**Step 1 Mindfulness labeling:**

We are, by default, not very aware of our own thoughts, emotions, surroundings, and perceptions, biases, and physical responses.

You begin by noticing the details. Ask the following questions:  
1. What is it about the situation that is making me anxious?  
2. What are all the emotions I am feeling?  
3. Who are the thoughts related to?  
4. Do you actually know what people are thinking?  
5. Do they have a real basis for forming any judgment?

**Step 2 Constructive rephrasing:**

Now, articulate your thoughts and emotions with precision. It is important that you aim for precision. Learn new vocabulary if you need to. Suppose your feeling is captured by the thought ‘I feel like shit,’ mindfully label all the details and articulate it into something like ‘I feel ignored or judged because there is something wrong with me or I am dressed inappropriately.’

Add the emotional context- ‘I feel like an overwhelming spotlight is on top of me. This makes me conscious, self-aware, and critical.’

Once you’ve articulated your thoughts, it is time to rephrase them into something actionable. For example- I need to address this feeling and do something about it. Something that is in my control. Let me observe and see how others are dressed. Let me see if there is any real evidence of me being judged. I feel like I don’t know what to do, I should learn the skills.

This change is actionable. You can do something about it. This will help you **gain control**. You need it, and you \*are\* in control.

A couple of years ago when I was in that situation, I went to a random apartment complex and dumped my trash in their trash. This year though, I am staying in a neighbourhood with houses. Last week, I used a public trash bin but it's so small. Now I have so much trash in my room (all in bags, so no smell and no mess) and I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm like on the verge of panicking. Add to that the fact that the host scares the crap out of me. I need a plan to throw everything away. I think I might go to a public park and just dump a little trash in all the bins once the sun is down.

t2_27r1n0ul,"A cowardly dog is trapped in the corner… all it's life it's been beaten and the only reason it survived was by running away, hiding and whimpering. But now it's cornered, for the first time it can't escape… it now has no choice but to fight viciously for survival. This illustrates the desperate way that our damaged subconscious mind tries to hold on to power and control over us in an attempt to “protect” us and keep us “safe” from harm.
In our childhood the only choice we had was to run, hide or cower in fear. Now, as an adult we have dug deep into the depths of our psyche and we now understand our dysfunction… however, our minds still do not trust us to take control of matters that involve our emotional safety… as a result, it attacks us with convincing arguments that if we try we will fail, there's no point in trying, fighting back leads to pain, give up, run, hide, cower… our minds fill us with fear, dread, anxiety and depression… every and any debilitating emotion to stop us from doing what it feels is dangerous. That is, to confront our fears and try new healthier ways to cope and live. But now our subconscious mind is cornered, there's no way out… you have chosen to refuse to give up, it's you and the cornered animal and only one of you will survive. The problem is, that YOU are the cornered animal, and the only way you walk out is by taming the beast, domesticating it, letting it know that you are in control, letting it know that you are grateful for it keeping you safe the only way it knew how for so many years. But now, YOU are in control and you need to let your mind know that you will protect it now, and that you will not let bad things happen to it again.

Recovery vs Fear of the Unknown 

For those of us with any sort of childhood trauma, fear of the unknown is debilitating. Our childhood trauma taught us that certainty within any given situation is the most important thing. For us, uncertainty was seen as certainty that bad things would happen. Therefore in our lives today, as bad as depression and anxiety is, we are familiar with it… and trying something new,  or trying to do things differently  may fill us with more fear and apprehension, which in turn keeps us trapped in our familiar prison of depression and anxiety.

For me, this is a basic outline of my history.

Initial childhood trauma lasting 18 years.

Maladapted coping mechanisms formed:

•	Denial
•	Suppression
•	Distraction
•	Subjugation
•	Enmeshment
•	Underdeveloped sense of self 
•	People pleasing 
•	Approval Seeking
•	Validation seeking
•	Substance abuse
•	Self pity

After the initial trauma lasting 18 years, it was followed by over 20 years of living a false, people pleasing, codependent identity which ultimately culminated extreme and debilitating depression and anxiety.
For me, recovery meant:

Making a start at refusing to deny, suppress and distract myself from the fact that I have a problem.

Making a start at refusing to be subjugated, people please, approval seek or validation seek.

Making a start at giving myself praise, validation and approval.

My maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, co-dependency, approval and validation seeking all gave me a measure of pleasure and good endorphin release, albeit disfunctionally... therefore, as I started to eliminate maladapted coping mechanisms I started to experience less positive feelings and more stabilized and constant feelings of depression.

Understanding and Acceptance

Once you understand, in as much detail as possible, the precise links between your childhood trauma and your current behaviour and feelings, you might be lucky enough to transform your feelings of depression, anxiety and sadness into anger against the injustice of life itself... anger is a not to be underestimated important step to reach because it is a necessary driver of change... but even then you will not automatically experience joy, peace, calm and happiness... in fact, this type of appropriate anger can and will lead to cynicism, bitterness and resentment, and so it is important to move to the next step in your recovery which is acceptance.

Acceptance.

Acceptance of what happened in your childhood, acceptance of how those things made you who you are today, acceptance that you were and are not to blame for any of it, acceptance that you cannot change the past, acceptance that you are who you are in the now, acceptance that in the now you are the best version of you that you can be... acceptance of the fact that you now have determination to slowly improve your person and your life in frustratingly small steps, every day, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year... acceptance of the resolve to not give up come what may.

The thing is, most likely, your mind does not know how to feel safe, positive and happy in a normal way. At a default subconscious level your mind will want to revert back to denial, suppression, distraction, a desire to find meaning through enmeshment, self pity and substance abuse or another well established self destructive behaviours. The sad fact is, is that your mind does not yet know how to cope or exist in any other state other than sadness, depression and maladapted and dysfunctional ways of coping and feeling better about things. Therefore it is important to teach your mind new ways to cope with feelings of negativity and new and healthier ways to experience joy, pleasure and happiness... this will present a real challenge for you, because even on a conscious level, you may simply not know how. Initially, you may simply have to go through the mechanical motions of doing things that you know are suppose to make you feel better... like going for walk, doing something artistic, outdoor activities, social activities, listening to music that is happy, not jaded or angry music, or depressing love songs etc.

At times however, we may need to go back and feel the fullness of our pain so as to explore and learn from it, to heal it through resolution... but we cannot live in a state of pain. We may need to revisit feeling angry over the injustices of our life, but we cannot live angry... 

So balance is required, because although we want to live in a happy headspace, this does not mean slipping into denial, suppression and distraction.... it means that we have felt the fullness of our sadness and anger... we accept what we feel, we acknowledge our past and with that acceptance and acknowledgement, we now choose to engage in positive activities to teach ourselves how to be happy in a healthy way.

This being said, the first stage to reach from depression and anxiety is anger, because you are making the switch from flight to fight, but you don't want to stay angry or you will be consumed by cynicism, bitterness and resentment... so you need to move on to the next stage which is resolute acceptance... 

After that you need to establish a new set of personal boundaries, or a realm, or scope of life that you want establish to live within... to find joy within... to find personal fulfilment and meaning and purpose within. Establishing a new life within which you want to live.

Acceptance is important, but it is important to know and get well acquainted with and pursue the healthy things that you want and enjoy in life, that will help you to cope and recover further. 

An important thing to remember is that recovery will not mean that your life will ever be as though your childhood trauma never happened... it will never be how it was before you were debilitated by anxiety and depression... however, just because this may be the case, it does not mean that whatever life you choose to create won't be wonderful.

For me that means pursuing things like art, exercise, weight loss, happy music, lego, movies, gaming, fishing, camping, creativity, appropriate self love and self respect through proper personal hygiene, care, grooming, dress and helping others to better their lives purely for the joy of giving without falling back into co-dependent or people pleasing patterns.

At this stage you may question why? Why bother? You may fear that doing or pursuing these things is ultimately pointless and little more than distracting yourself with positivity. This may be true to a degree, but not entirely, and you will need to be able to recognize that your resistance to pursuing these things amounts predominantly to your own deep seated fear of failure when you try to effect change for the better... your mind may still be trying to hang on to the familiarity of depression and anxiety because it knows how to disfunctionally make you feel better and will always try to pull you back to familiar things to your own detriment because it is convinced that you will be better of with the dysfunction you know, than the uncertainty of doing something new that might fail.

Regret nothing, feel ashamed over nothing, feel guilty over nothing, the past has made you the good and insightful and thoughtful and compassionate person that you are. To regret, feel shame or guilt is to regret that you are who you are, to feel shame and guilt over who you are... which is little more than self hate. Life did not give you the love, nurturing and protection that you deserved... so accept that you are who you are due to a life that was not of your planning and control and was ultimately indifferent, random and cruel.

Armed with this acceptance, move forward and choose to be who you want to be... choose to do what you want to do... choose to live how you want to live... refuse to go on allowing life to happen to you... take charge and become the architect of your future... even if it's hard... even if it's scarey... even though it's unclear whether you will fail or succeed.

t2_1hz8vl4l,"TW: domestic abuse

have struggled with anxiety since I was in 4th grade. I caught myself crying over the silliest of things, all the time. It has only gotten worse.

It got really bad when I dated this guy for 5 years. Everything was going great for the first half of our relationship - we were that picture-perfect couple that everyone wanted to be. To keep a long story short, we had a falling out and broke up. We talked everything through months later and decided to get back together. I thought everything would be fine. 

I was dead wrong. 

He started physically abusing me. He started calling me every name in the book. He told me that he was the only person that would ever love me - he convinced me that my mother, my father, my sister, my brothers...all hated me, and it was an “obligation” to treat me right because I’m part of the family and it would be “f**cked up” to blatantly tell me that they didn’t love me. I was fully convinced. And I guess I just haven’t been able to shake it yet. He left me shortly after our 5 year anniversary. 

Now, I am not saying that he is the reason I have anxiety - I was diagnosed with it for far more reasons than this. This just made it that much worse. 

I am now in a relationship of 3 months with this wonderful guy that takes awesome care of me. I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. But I catch myself, almost every night, not being able to sleep from anxiety. Anxiety of him leaving. Anxiety that he just doesn’t love me anymore and questioning who would even love me to begin with. I have talked to him about it once or twice and he has reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he loves me - but I still can’t shake it. I shake, I get nauseous, and I get that lump in my throat that tells me to cry but I can’t. So I just stare at the ceiling and hope it passes. 

I have two best friends that I wouldn’t trade for the world, and I am even convinced that they don’t like being around me anymore. I’ve isolated myself, I’ve stopped answering phone calls from them, I’ve bailed on them. I feel like an awful friend, but I feel like I seriously just can’t freaking help it. I’ve mentioned it to them and they’ve also reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, but it’s like there’s a devil on my shoulder telling me that they’re lying. 

I don’t know how much longer I can keep feeling this way. I need help. I’m struggling.

Anxiety that he just doesn’t love me anymore and questioning who would even love me to begin with. I have talked to him about it once or twice and he has reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he loves me - but I still can’t shake it. I shake, I get nauseous, and I get that lump in my throat that tells me to cry but I can’t. So I just stare at the ceiling and hope it passes. 

I have two best friends that I wouldn’t trade for the world, and I am even convinced that they don’t like being around me anymore. I’ve isolated myself, I’ve stopped answering phone calls from them, I’ve bailed on them. I feel like an awful friend, but I feel like I seriously just can’t freaking help it. I’ve mentioned it to them and they’ve also reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, but it’s like there’s a devil on my shoulder telling me that they’re lying. 

I don’t know how much longer I can keep feeling this way. I need help. I’m struggling. 

 I feel like everyone hates me",461,6,467,0.145,0.685,0.171,0.9565

I get weird about my breathing, especially in public places like a classroom or movie theater. My vision is blurred nowadays from the lack of sleep, and my body is hyper sensitive to everything. I'm constantly fatigued, and I'm struggling to deal with everyday tasks.

Two nights ago I tried Diphenhydramine as a sleep aid, and it worked... But now last night it didn't work, even after taking a Benedryl with it like a pharmacist had suggested.

I'm not on any medication and hadn't been for years, but it just seems like things are spiraling out of control. I can't sleep for shit, much less want to be in a classroom. I used to enjoy sleep so much... I don't know why everything went to shit the way it did. It's been like this for weeks now. I'm debating on seeing a psych, but psychs have always made me nervous especially due to a previous Benzodiazepine addiction. At night my mind just races and paces along with my heart, and I can't even think properly like I used to. I could daydream and think about anything, but the brain fog has made everything uncertain.

I have an exam Wednesday I'm sure, and yet I can't even get out of bed to go turn in assignments in my damn Math 053 class. I've tried melatonin, blue light filters, strict bed time schedules... I just don't get why everything is going to shit or how to stop it. Depression is ruining any enjoyment of leisure activities I might have as well.

Or if I should even care anymore.

Since then, he has been in intensive inpatient therapy, and now is in outpatient therapy.  He is doing well, scaling his days on a better than fair scale.  He says he feels better and behaviorally he is far more engaged with friends and family.  All guns, rifle and ammo were removed and are stored offsite and he does not know where.

It seems like every time I’ve needed to leave my house over the last few days my anxiety sky rockets, sweaty palms, nausea and just a general sense of anxiety and not being able to breathe. 

I’m due to start a new job, which is also a university course in May. I didn’t think I was anxious about this, but maybe it’s what set it off? 

I was supposed to be spending the day with my boyfriend in the town about 20 minutes away, but as soon as I got to the bus stop I had to come home. He came to my house to sit with me and calm me down, which helped massively, and encouraged me to get onto the bus with him. I managed to, but as soon as I got into his town I got super anxious again, nausea, shaking,  dizziness and couldn’t breathe. We stopped in a pub near the bus stop where I called my mum (my saviour) and I decided I needed to go home. 

I can’t thank my boyfriend enough for what he does for me, and today was the first time he’s seen my anxiety this bad.

I’m due to start a new job, which is also a university course in May. I didn’t think I was anxious about this, but maybe it’s what set it off? 

I was supposed to be spending the day with my boyfriend in the town about 20 minutes away, but as soon as I got to the bus stop I had to come home. He came to my house to sit with me and calm me down, which helped massively, and encouraged me to get onto the bus with him. I managed to, but as soon as I got into his town I got super anxious again, nausea, shaking,  dizziness and couldn’t breathe. We stopped in a pub near the bus stop where I called my mum (my saviour) and I decided I needed to go home. 

I can’t thank my boyfriend enough for what he does for me, and today was the first time he’s seen my anxiety this bad. 

I really really don’t want it to get so bad that it reaches the point I can’t leave my house without feeling like this. It’s tiring, and I want to be able to live my life. I like going out, and I like being able to feel happy and content while I’m out. 

If anyone feels like this, please give me some helpful pointers or just encouragement. God knows I need some today. 

Thank you:)  Just need to let it all out.",295,7,302,0.113,0.717,0.17,0.9755

My body's feeling weird ""is it a chronic illness?""
But mostly it's my chest. 

I don't know if it's anxiety or stress or a chronic illness, my chest(left side)  hurts and aches randomly. Mostly before sleeping and I feel like there's something wrong with me?

I don't smoke, I don't have a high blood pressure(not that I know) there's no possible reason why I would have a heart disease. Except stress? There's exams now but the school doesnt stop the after school activities. Doesn't help that I have an important biannual competition coming up.

I always thought of myself as a jovial person. But last February alone, I've had the most number of mental breakdowns than EVER. To give you an idea, my best friends of three years were shocked when I mentioned that i easily cry when i get emotionally overhwelmed.

t2_3np8se2c,"My boyfriend is extremely sensitive to loud, sudden noises, and I have anxiety about loud noises in general. You would think that this would make us both reluctant to be around or create loud noises, right?

Nope. At least in his case.

My boyfriend works in a factory where loud noises are basically ubiquitous, and he has to wear earplugs to protect his ears. The problem arises when I pick him up from work, and he speaks at really high volume. While in the car. Which is a really small space that amplifies sounds because small.

It's awful, trying to drive home while he's either practically shouting in the car, or fooling around on his phone and randomly bursting out into loud, sudden laughter. It's not as bad at home, as we tend to hang out in different rooms, but he has a very bad habit of making fun of how quietly I usually talk. Sometimes he even leans in and goes ""WHAT?"" really loudly if I'm too quiet. It startles me every time, and some days it ratchets my anxiety up to 11.

I have tried dozens of times to ask him to please stop doing that, but he usually forgets by the next day, or he doesn't understand why it bothers me and doesn't make an effort to stop. I don't know what to do about it. And it makes no sense that he complains about being sensitive to loud noises when he, himself, is a loud noise almost all the time.

I'll have a night of really bad anxiety, maybe have an attack and then I'll just be lethargic and depressed for the rest of the following day. I had one of those days Saturday evening and Sunday morning. But Saturday night I talked to my mom and she urged me to set up an appointment and she even cut me a check for it. 

I had a dentist appointment that was the source of a lot of my anxiety and while in the waiting room stressing I decided to text the therapist and she got back to me and set up a meeting for today (Tuesday). I feel like doing that at the height of my anxiety really helped me get through the dentist appointment and the migraine to follow. (I just got crowns on my front teeth. Yay... more anxiety fighting because before I was afraid to smile and have people see my dying tooth) 

This morning I determined my anxiety would make me do two things to avoid the appointment. I wouldn't get out of bed, and I'd feel crappy about myself and not want to get ready. So I made myself get up earlier even though the appointment was in the afternoon, and I proceeded to spend my morning cleaning my room and hanging up some pictures I had been meaning to get to. Definitely helped get myself out the door. 

For the appointment itself I was internally playing out the rick and morty episode ""pickle Rick"" thinking about all the other tasks at home I could be doing instead of being here. I sat in the car for a bit but I went in on time. 

I hadn't been emotional all morning but of course the moment I started trying to talk I choked up. Embarrassed I tried to hide it, and of course I started holding my breath, because I knew if I let it out I'd start hyper ventilating. She had me do some breathing exercises which felt awful because a stranger was watching me sob with my eyes closed. But I have tried breathing exercises before and I know I should do them more often. 

She asked about medications if I was interested and ended up suggesting essential oils and physical exercise. (I.e. running/jogging for me). There's some pseudoscience and mlm scams when it comes to essential oils but I know no shortage of distributors in my circle. 

Does anyone have an experience or recommendations for oils? I have a few. My therapist suggested lavender. And I personally find associating the smell of Rose with calm has helped me.

Ive always been anxious every now and then, but I’ve not been well for what seems to be 2-3 consecutive months now. I had several blood labs done to rule out any sort of disease, and they all came back normal. I was given propranolol to use when I feel anxious, but that never worked. I was then given Hydroxyzine; which made me feel a bit better, but that’s no longer the case. A few days ago, I stood in front of a crowd while somebody presented me a certificate, and I damn near almost fainted. I’ve always hated being the center of attention, but the feeling of almost fainting is brand new to me. 

The next day I went to a ceremony and had to leave once I saw how many people were in attendance. I ended up leaving and driving to a nearby city for the weekend.

The day after, I was trapped  in a car with 5 people in the back and it felt like I had a panic attack. We went to the movies, and it happened again, with the addition of weak arms and some dizziness. I walked a bit outside to calm myself and we ended up going into the theatre. I tried to sleep through the movie, but I couldn’t because of the general uneasy feeling and muscle twitches. I eventually left and fell asleep.

2 hour drive back home I felt as if the inside of my body was buzzing, so, I immediately took the Hydroxyzine when I made it to my apartment, but it seemed to have no effect.

Fell asleep after laying in bed for a half hour, and for the next few days, the uneasiness and buzzing would not stop.

Last night, I was laying on my couch and suddenly felt my head and hands shaking. I stood up and it seemed to go away until I laid down again. I decided to suck it up and sleep, which is where things got weird.

I have absolutely 0 idea if this was a reality or a dream, but in the moment, I felt shaking on one side of my face which, in a few seconds, led to my entire body violently shaking, and I remember not being able to breath well. From what I remember, this lasted about 10 seconds.

I reached for the phone, not knowing if what just happened was real or not, and saw that it was 2am. I honestly don’t even know if I had woken up from a dream or if that actually happened.

I felt normal and went back to bed. Now here I am at work, still feeling the buzzing, and terrified of what I just experienced.

I had several blood labs done to rule out any sort of disease, and they all came back normal. I was given propranolol to use when I feel anxious, but that never worked. I was then given Hydroxyzine; which made me feel a bit better, but that’s no longer the case. A few days ago, I stood in front of a crowd while somebody presented me a certificate, and I damn near almost fainted. I’ve always hated being the center of attention, but the feeling of almost fainting is brand new to me. 

The next day I went to a ceremony and had to leave once I saw how many people were in attendance. I ended up leaving and driving to a nearby city for the weekend.

The day after, I was trapped  in a car with 5 people in the back and it felt like I had a panic attack. We went to the movies, and it happened again, with the addition of weak arms and some dizziness. I walked a bit outside to calm myself and we ended up going into the theatre. I tried to sleep through the movie, but I couldn’t because of the general uneasy feeling and muscle twitches. I eventually left and fell asleep.

2 hour drive back home I felt as if the inside of my body was buzzing, so, I immediately took the Hydroxyzine when I made it to my apartment, but it seemed to have no effect.

Fell asleep after laying in bed for a half hour, and for the next few days, the uneasiness and buzzing would not stop.

Last night, I was laying on my couch and suddenly felt my head and hands shaking. I stood up and it seemed to go away until I laid down again. I decided to suck it up and sleep, which is where things got weird.

I have absolutely 0 idea if this was a reality or a dream, but in the moment, I felt shaking on one side of my face which, in a few seconds, led to my entire body violently shaking, and I remember not being able to breath well. From what I remember, this lasted about 10 seconds.

I reached for the phone, not knowing if what just happened was real or not, and saw that it was 2am. I honestly don’t even know if I had woken up from a dream or if that actually happened.

I felt normal and went back to bed. Now here I am at work, still feeling the buzzing, and terrified of what I just experienced.

t2_71gt57y,"Of course anxiety isn't really funny, but here's a couple stories that make me laugh from when I was younger.

So I have had extremely bad anxiety (primarily social) since about 5th grade. My anxiety peaked in 7th grade. I was so self conscious and I could NOT do anything in front of others. It was so bad that if I knew I had to say even a single word in front of the class, I would skip school or do anything to get out of it.
My last name starts with the letters AB, and my school always did everything alphabetically by last name. I was ALWAYS first, for everything. This includes swimming class. So, one day, I try to get out of swimming class by telling my gym teacher I didn't have my swimsuit. She was excited to tell me that she had one I could use.

Guess what color it was?

White. I bet you can guess why that's a problem. Of course 7th grade me didn't make that connection, sucked it up and went in the pool. You could see everything under that swimsuit. I still believe she gave me that one on purpose cause she hated me. Oh, and guess who had to be the one to demonstrate swim strokes in front of the whole class? Me. Yup. In a white see-through swimsuit. You bet I never went to a single swim class after that. It was traumatizing at the time but it makes me laugh now.

On to the next story (and my favorite).

It got to the point where I just couldn't go to school anymore because my anxiety was so bad. I just couldn't do it. I missed so many days of school that I had to go to court and my family was threatened with losing me. I ended up having to do community service. I was only 12! And nobody understood that it was anxiety causing me to miss school. I actually liked school itself. Just not being... around people. Anyways, so after I went to court I knew my family wouldn't let me stay home. But I sure as hell wasn't going to gym class, hell no! I came up with a plan. The night before school I loaded my backpack with donuts and snacks. Packed some warm clothes. I took the bus to school in the morning but instead of going into the school, I went behind the school and sat in a bush. For hours. Eating donuts. In the middle of winter. Just to miss gym class.

Eventually I decided I had skipped most of the classes I couldn't handle and went inside the school. I was immediately informed that the police were looking for me because the school called to inform my parents of my absence.

I   do think it is the only way for me to feel in control of my life and   responsible and that the confidence gained will allow me to aspire to   achieve other things (like a better job and another relationship) but   thus far, every time I've come really close to moving out and signing a   lease, I always back out at the last minute because I feel so worried   that I'm making a mistake and that I won't be able to live by myself. I   just can't make that leap of faith.

If   anyone's been in the same boat, what convinced you to move out and  live  by yourself and how did your expectations and fears match up with  the  reality? Terrified of living alone but feel it's the only way for me to grow?",528,14,542,0.133,0.753,0.115,-0.9322

t2_vfdbi,"A good example is what just happened about half an hour ago. My husband went out to get some shopping, and I made some lunch for myself and my 4 year old son.

t2_1oq2r6d5,"My wife suffers from anxiety.  We have two little kids.  Between that and just life, her anxiety tends to get triggered at least every other day. When she has an attack, she tends to get mean.  Almost always that meanness is directed at me.  She’ll talk to me disrespectfully and she is unfair.

In the past, I’ve tried to just let it slide.  I try to keep in mind that this is the anxiety and not her, but it’s hard when it happens so often.  I’ll say “I’m sorry that your anxious” to try and sign to her that she is being nasty to me, but she has trouble managing the attacks.  She works with a therapist, and she definitely has more control than she used to, but she still struggles quite a bit.

I wonder if letting it slide is doing more harm than good?  I’d prefer to not be around her when she is having an attack, but with the kids, it’s tough.  A lot of times I’ll ask her to leave to calm down, but since her anxiety stems from the kids, she has trouble leaving them.  And I have trouble leaving her with them when I know she’s already in an anxious state.  She and her therapist ask that I try to be supportive during these attacks, but when I try to offer help, she tends to be nasty back at me - it makes me not want to be nice.

t2_2k5k4nga,"Hi Reddit. I’m working towards my masters of Education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling currently and am also working full time doing program support at a University. I’m on my second year of coursework and my program is 100% in an online format. I graduated from undergrad in 2015 and went back to school in 2018. 

Since I’ve gone back, I have experienced severe anxiety related to performance and other random topics related to school. For example, have I paraphrased this well enough? Am I covering what the assignment is asking of me? I’m asking a LOT of what if questions. It’s constant. I don’t feel any form of relief until I have my grades back. For me, it isn’t about the grade. I don’t mind not making perfect scores. 

There is no former evidence of any poor performance in my studies. I’m actually extremely smart and driven and I take pride in the work I put out. I ask questions when I need to and I’m used to going the extra mile. But I’m so tired of this constant feeling of “doom” that is present. It makes getting through my readings and assignments extremely difficult. If the anxiety gets bad enough, which it often does, I’ll go into a major depressive episode. 

I’ve been diagnosed with MDD and GAD for quite some time. I’m seeing an incredible psychiatrist and I have struggled to find a therapist I connect with in the city I am, but saw one last week that I’m hoping is the right one. As someone who is studying the field, I feel like I need CBT but I also just think I need to do some self-compassion work. 

I’m about half way done with my program and cannot continue to work through the courses in this much of an anxious state. I’m thinking about taking short breaks in between my courses so I have time to re charge. Anyway, trying to sort it all out and take cRe of myself at the same time.

t2_12m4pdy,"So about a year ago I started having daily panic attacks due to this strange thing happening to me. I feel like I can't breathe even though I can. Like I'm not getting enough oxygen even though I can breath just fine. 

This started last year and pops up every once in a while causing really bad anxiety. I went to the doctor and they did every test under the sun and everything came up that I was in perfect health. I started therapy and my therapist thinks it's a symptom of my anxiety, which may be true but the weird thing is sometimes I just wake up with that feeling but no anxiety and the anxiety comes later.

I thought I was the only one with this until I started talking to a friend who said that he was struggling with anxiety really bad and he told me he was experiencing the exact same feeling! He even also went to the doctor and got told there was nothing wrong.

I had it yesterday at work and it caused a panic attack again. Had to go into the bathroom for a bit until it cleared up. Starts with me feeling like I can't breath then I get tunnel vision and light headed then the anxiety comes bad.

I just wanted to see if anyone else has any experience with these symptoms since I know atleast one other person is experiencing the same thing.

* Have a decent amount saved (enough to pay for a year's rent)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm    reaching that point in my life where I feel I just need to do   something  different (as this usual routine of mine is not going to   solve things)  and I keep coming back to the idea of moving out and   living on my own. I  would be renting, as buying is not possible at the   moment.

Obviously,   it's going to be a  challenge, but what I fear the most is being alone   at night, in a  house all by myself and having those terror-inducing   thoughts that  make me freak out. Whether it's being terrified of someone   breaking  in, the house catching fire, having a heart attack alone,   choking to  death on food, etc.

I   just know my  mind is going to go there, because it already does when I   live in my  usual, relatively comfortable environment and have someone  to  rely on  for emotional support.

Take   away  those crutches I fall back on and I can see myself struggling to   sleep  through the night and becoming incredibly anxious about the most    mundane things that ordinarily I can handle quite well.

What    is there that can make me see that this will get better and that   living  alone by myself doesn't have to be so daunting and overwhelming?

I    do think it is the only way for me to feel in control of my life and    responsible and that the confidence gained will allow me to aspire to    achieve other things (like a better job and another relationship) but    thus far, every time I've come really close to moving out and signing a    lease, I always back out at the last minute because I feel so worried    that I'm making a mistake and that I won't be able to live by myself.

t2_2h4a2shf,"This is actually my first post on reddit so I want to apologize in advance if this post doesnt follow normal protocol or if I'm breaking any rules. I'l try to start with some context which I think is relevant. Growing up I was always quite confident, I had numerous extracurricular leadership positions in high school and was always very sociable. I would go out to party's almost every weekend and was quite a heavy drinker, this continued into University. My first year at University I kind of developed an eating disorder? I would eat very little or nothing at all for a few days then go out and drink till I passed out. The next day or couple of days I would binge eat. In my second year I started experimenting with drugs, it started off mainly with MDMA and ecstasy, I started using it almost every time I went out. At the end of second year I started using cocaine and ketamine as well. By third year I was using all three and most often mix them in the same night. IE I would start the night by drinking, then take some MDMA then some COKE then some Ketamine and then fall as sleep by smoking a joint. It's also perhaps worth noting that I smoked for two years at university but have since stopped. Whilst at University I also had two family deaths, where one was self-inflicted. My symptoms really became a problem about a year ago, I was on holiday with my girlfriend where we were drinking almost every evening and one morning I had a really bad episode or attack. It usually creeps up on me, it will start out of nowhere and can be triggered by any change in environment. When it happens I feel almost panicked and I'm not sure why, but for me the worst sensation is that I feel disconnected from whats going on and as If I'm going to feint at any moment, I also struggle to focus on anything, and my vision almost becomes blurry. If its a really bad episode then I get an upset stomach as well. When I have an attack I become most afraid of my heart and I fear that I will have a heart attack, part of this concern comes from the fact that my family has a history of heart failure. Another symptom I get almost daily is this strange pressure on my chest, as if something is pushing on it. It makes me constantly tug at my shirt to get it away from touching my chest. I finally went to the doctors about 7 months ago and basically broke down crying because I didnt know what was wrong with me and it was the first time I kind of acknowledged that something was going on. The doctor sent me to see a cardiologist where I did numerous ECG's and blood work and it all came back fine, nothing wrong. The doctor didn't follow up with me and I didnt have the courage to make another appointment to admit the symptoms to her all over again. So what I decided to do is to completely stop drinking, I haven't drank since January and I havent had a major attack since then, but I do still experience the more minor symptoms where I can't focus on anything. Other triggers include when I dont eat properly or if I drink too much caffeine. Maybe its also worth noting that I'm a really active person, I do a lot of exercise, sometimes when exercising I feel a bit feint but I usually force myself to continue.

For instance, I love coffee, I was even up to 4 cups a day before. But lately, even 1-2 cups can get my anxiety turned up to 11. Drinking tea or decaf is a big lifestyle and identity change.

For example: 
My brother was very overweight as a child, I remember making fun of him and rubbing it in his face when I was eating chocolate cake.. I don’t remember my age but it makes me feel disgusting and so horrible ..I bullied my brother a lot, we have a strained relationship and I’ve called him stupid, pathetic, loser even recently..like maybe 4-5 years ago. He’s a drug addict with behavioral issues and it kills me that I wasn’t more empathetic and understanding, even tho he did make it quite difficult I know that underneath all these issues he is a good person who is just very insecure and sad

My mom went on a business trip for 3 weeks when I was around 7, she brought me home a bunch of toys and instead of saying thank you I said “next time, can you get ___ instead”

Another thing, when I was a child I was very “cute” and loved getting gifts and attention from distant family and my parents friends ...I remember once I pressured my poor brother into asking one of my dads friends  if she had any presents for us.. my brother didn’t want to but I kept pressuring him ..he’s 4 years older than me but very immature for his age and quite impressionable ..he crumbles under pressure and I took advantage of that and I couldn’t have been any older than 8, I don’t understand how an 8 year old was capable of being so horrible

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember how long I ""tried to"" change things. More than ten years probably. Including but not limited to: being more productive, being more social/communicative, getting to know new people, keeping in touch with old people, being more self-confident, being fitter, exercising regularly, eating healthier, cooking my own food, fixing my sleeping schedule, living healthier in general, producing less waste, travelling more, reading the news more thoroughly, reading more books, practicing the piano more, spending less time on the internet etc.

&amp;#x200B;

And with all these things, I dreamed big. I was young and I thought, the sky is the limit. Ten years gone by. The success rate: nearly zero. Let's be honest: zero. With the usual ups and downs, all those things actually got worse. Until last year. But before I get into my small successes since then you might say I am too hard on myself. That there is no way everything went downhill the last ten years. And you are right. I achieved a lot and nearly all of it due to social pressure. Yeah, social pressure is great in general to replace discipline. In my experience it doesn't work long term though. In the end lazy habits were stronger than self-imposed social pressure and discipline didn't want to build up fast enough. So I read about motivation and discipline and made so many plans, set up mantras and signed imaginary contracts with myself and abided none of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how I see it. Due to my anxiety, I am afraid of change. Changing things is so exhausting, that after a few weeks maximum I kind of have to fall back into my old habits. That's why I don't want to change. So, you think, my answer is just: Accept the way you are and be happy? Yes and no. If I had just done that, I probably would have lived the last ten years happier with the same outcome. But the outcome is still bad. This is the big ambiguity in my life that brought me to the verge of despair: How can I accept the way I am while constantly being encouraged to change for the better at the same time? Simple answer: Too much media consumption fucks up your brain and its expectations of life in our society. But that's not my topic.

&amp;#x200B;

What about my successes in the last year? I stopped trying to change things. We always hear about getting out of our comfort zone. To jump into the cold water. If the anxiety is too strong though, you won't jump off the 10 feet diving tower, whatever people tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my successes is doing push-ups, pull-ups and squats. A few sets of a few each at least twice a week now. Sounds pathetic for someone exercising seriously but for me it's a success. I started from being able to do two single correct pushups a few months ago. My motivation was not to become muscular or fit. I also didn't aim for doing like 50 push-ups in a row or 100 push-ups a day or something stupid like that. I was rather interested in learning to do push-ups. I didn't make plans how to proceed. After a few weeks I could do ten in a row and I started adding pull-ups and soon after I added squats without weights. In terms of strength I now feel as fit as I felt over five years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I could have joined a gym. With a professional trainer I could have had the same sucesses after weeks not after months. I know that. I could have done that ten years ago. But I haven't. Because I stood at the edge of the diving tower and jumping was too scary. And if you can't rely on people throwing you into the water(social pressure) over and over again, what can you do? Take a run-up. For me, doing two single push-ups was the start of my run-up. Just start and proceed so slowly, that you don't realize getting faster. Until you're so fast in the end you couldn't even stop at the edge if you tried to.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. I know it's nothing revolutionary. Who knows if I carry on with my run-up. And if I do who knows, if I ever get to the jump in the end. But that is my point actually. Everyone will tell you to start slowly if you want to change. For me it's about not even trying to change. Not even knowing if there is a jump at the end. When I don't expect to change things, I change the most apparently.

Take a run-up. For me, doing two single push-ups was the start of my run-up. Just start and proceed so slowly, that you don't realize getting faster. Until you're so fast in the end you couldn't even stop at the edge if you tried to.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. I know it's nothing revolutionary. Who knows if I carry on with my run-up. And if I do who knows, if I ever get to the jump in the end. But that is my point actually. Everyone will tell you to start slowly if you want to change. For me it's about not even trying to change. Not even knowing if there is a jump at the end. When I don't expect to change things, I change the most apparently. So I will continue to take run-ups and see where they will lead me.

I'm really not sure where to post this but I'm in a really bad place right now when it comes to fitness. I am currently on a cut and have been training for 5 few years now but only just started being extremely consistent over the last year. 

Over the last 2 months (started when I started counting calories) my anxiety has been through the roof. After every gym session I'm evaluating whether I worked hard enough (I could collapse but still persuade myself that I could have worked harder) and i can feel myself developing an eating disorder. I'm constantly opening my fitness pal to ensure that I know my calories even though I have checked them hundreds of times in a day and I panic if I eat anything un-planned. Anyway it's all starting to take its toll, I have been ill the last couple of days, I have absolutely no motivation and/or energy to go to the gym and I can't sleep...for the first time ever I walked in and straight back out of the gym yesterday....I just didn't want to be there.

I'm planning on taking a week off but I'm not sure if this is the best move as if I lose muscle it might tip me over the edge. But at the same time I think taking a week off might really help reset my mind and body and make me realise what's important to me.

   E V E R Y T H I N G. 

Like, walking down the street, I get so nervous even though I'm just walking like everyone else! I feel like everyone is watching me and they are talking about me (even though they don't know me and I don't know them). I also feel like what if the way I walk is embarassing? What if my way of walking is incorrect? (If there's such a thing). 

And I'm so paranoid. One time I woke up and I saw nobody downstairs, my immediate thoughts are: ""What if someone broke into our house and took them?"" and ""What if they are dead upstairs? And the killer is just there.."" and many more thoughts, all were negative. 

I'm so scared that time, I'm just sitting and looking at the stairs. Tempted to go up but too scared to do so. Then after a few minutes, I saw my Auntie going down the stairs- normal, alive and breathing. 

Nothing bad happened. 

Looks like she's just doing some errands upstairs and my grandfather is peacefully sleeping. 

Then after that, I relaxed. 

That's just one of the many moments were my thoughts are severely negative. 

Plus, every night, everytime I hear the sound of an airplane I feel like it's going to crash into our house. And I think that what if it's a meteor closely hitting us? (it may sound funny but I think like that every time I hear that sound). So I end up shaking and covering my ears hoping that it will just stop. 

And... I always feels like I'd die anytime. Literally. And it's so scary that sometime I come to a point that I don't want to do any thing and just lie there because I find everything useless...since I'm gonna die.

That's all. I'm sorry if this post is too messy to understand? And I'm sorry too if there are LOTS of grammatical errors (english is not my first language :&lt; )

I was privileged enough to get a scholarship to go this past winter and it was an amazing feeling of adventure and freedom that I desperately want to experience again.

My mind keeps changing thinking about it. Is spending that money going to be worth it? I'm going to be going to the other side of the world while my mom is at home alone and having chronic pain. How can I leave her like that? I can't bring get with me everywhere but anything I do I have the thought in the back of my head that I don't deserve to enjoy while she can't. A bit back, seeing me bored out of my mind and sitting at home with nothing to do, she even encouraged me to go. Then, she changed her position and started asking what's the point and if it would be worth spending so much money. 

This feels like it's such an insignificant thing but at the same time, I want to go back and have that freedom being away from home. I want to have that feeling of adventure exploring new things. I grew up in a household that wasn't very happy. I watched my dad leave and my mom work day in and day out to take care of me and pay the bills. I appreciate all that she's done but I don't want to be eternally bound to her while not feeling like an unappreciative son. I want to be free and enjoy life like other people.

There are too many things I am worried about:
-I don't think I deserve to travel or enjoy myself while my mom can't and my dad is depressed. 
-I'm graduating soon but I feel like my dad and I will get into an agreement about how I'm not happy like he thinks I should be as he did at both my middle and high school graduations. 
-I have a job I never dreamed of but I can't help but feel like I'm making a mistake in going down this route and don't really have much of an understanding of what is right to do growing as the only son of first generation immigrants living in a very different and constantly changing world.
-I want to travel and feel like I did this past winter but I keep thinking it won't be worth it and the cost and leaving my mom alone outweighs the benefit, especially now that she is having chronic pain and issues walking the day after I booked the flight.

I'm stuck cycling between concern after concern until I get overwhelmed and feel forced to take lorazepam to calm myself down. Over a year of therapy and almost a year on antidepressants and things continue to feel hopeless. I don't know how I'm supposed to live when I feel powerless to change anything. I don't want to just put my head down and dissociate my way through life. I already don't remember much from years and years of childhood because I was just trying to get through it hoping for better days rather than being a kid. Now I'm in my early twenties and have never dated, gave up the college experience to stay close to my mom and save money, and regret living with my head down for so so long.

t2_172mmw83,"Heads up,this is super long and I’m kind of all over the place from lack of sleep.

But Hello everyone!

I just came across this sub today upon reflection of underlying anxiety in everyday life. 

I know judging from the title this sounds like a very generic thing people go through from time to time, but I just wanted to get some other opinions and thoughts on the matter. Please limit responses to only constructive criticisms or advice, I get enough grief from my mom :) 

So here is some background.
I guess I would best describe my patterns of productivity to a yo-yo diet. 
From time to time I will have my moments of obsessive ambitions, and start off my projects with some commitment and a good attitude; some examples would be wanting to exercise and following a workout regiment to the T for the first week or so, or wanting to paint, thusly purchasing supplies and working on a canvas.

But then something happens overtime. 

The quality of my work degrades from what it started off as, I make excuses or occupy myself with other things, and then I have intrusive thoughts that discourage me from continuing to pursue completion of said project. It doesn’t always happen in this order, but I notice these are common events. 

That being said, I’m currently unemployed (was let go from budget cuts) and am a student living with my boyfriend who is a part-time worker and student. 

I’ve applied to many places and haven’t heard back. I know I can’t be picky with my choices, so I’ve just apply to wherever I can. But, when I start up the computer I just feel this sense of dread reviewing job options. 

I think about how much I’m going to hate talking to people. I stress about if my coworkers will like me or not, and I worry about balancing my school and work life. I also am consumed with fear of being unqualified or unprepared for the responsibilities from all the costly mistakes I’ve made in my prior jobs (messing up orders from anxiety, mishandling socialization/making serial social faux pas). But on top of that, I constantly hate myself for not being comfortable working. It’s not the principle of working itself that makes me upset, it’s that it seems everyone else is functioning, even thriving, in their work spaces with their coworkers and with their work obligations without any sense of doubt in themselves. I can’t help but look at myself and wonder “why can’t I be that competent like they are?”

All of this surmises to me generally feeling like I can’t accomplish anything and just passively avoiding things by being on Reddit (ta-da), other apps then scolding myself and feeling ashamed at bedtime because I haven’t done anything to directly improve my situation. 

It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard for me to push myself to participate in regular things, like hanging out with my boyfriend’s family at important milestone events or complete necessary chores. 

So here it is (finally): could this be described or attributed to anxiety and how could I best deal with this?

t2_3vesg0ln,"After being medicated on and off the past 17 years for anxiety and panic disorders, my new psychiatrist has made a compelling argument that my anxiety is due to adult ADHD. He convinced me to try Vyvanse in conjunction with Inderole, and also diazepam on hand as a last resort.

My initial reaction to this whole idea was skepticism. Sure, I do check a lot of the boxes for ADHD, but I've never tolerated stimulants that well. Amphetamines, in particular, can give me a nasty, dysphoric edginess at therapeutic doses.

The thing is though, the thought keeps occurring to me that much of my anxiety is situational.

I'm afraid to go outside, afraid to interact with people, and so I don't. I hide from these interactions and seek comfort and relief in benzodiazepines, which are sedatives. 

Consequently, I feel temporarily better... but I am less proactive. More unsolved problems seem to pile up, my outlook gets worse, and I eventually the benzos stop working. It's a vicious cycle that's probably pretty familiar to most people on this sub.

I recently quit my job because I was physically threatened by a coworker and management didn't care to intervene. The subsequent panic attacks were debilitating - but at the same time, it was a shit job and better things surely await. To get there, perhaps the motivation from a drug like Vyvanse can help me ""get ahead of the curve"" so to speak?

I seem to be a lot more motivated and getting things done, but I can already feel my nerves starting to fray a bit, and Vyvanse slight but steady edginess almost eclipses diazepam's effects entirely at times. It's not untenable, but it does seem a little counterproductive.

Anyway, would really love some feedback from anyone else who has both ADHD and anxiety, or has had a similar medication experience.

He convinced me to try Vyvanse in conjunction with Inderole, and also diazepam on hand as a last resort.

My initial reaction to this whole idea was skepticism. Sure, I do check a lot of the boxes for ADHD, but I've never tolerated stimulants that well. Amphetamines, in particular, can give me a nasty, dysphoric edginess at therapeutic doses.

I’m usually the DD at parties because I don’t ever get super drunk (I hate the loss of control) but I like hanging out and having fun with people, to a certain extent. But after a period of time I get super drained - it can be debilitating if I surpass my limit and it’s worse when I know I can’t get home for a while. 

My anxiety has been insane lately and I’ve developed a fear of being alone. So I’ve been going out even if I don’t want to and doing whatever people I’m around want to do. It’s just been a distraction I guess, but I mostly still feel unhappy.

It’s getting exhausting and of course I want my friends to have fun and I want to make sure they get home safely, but why am I always the thing between them stumbling around in an alley and being safe in their bed.

BUT let’s backtrack a little. A few weeks ago I started Adderall XR slow release to help with my racing thoughts. Before I was on 15mg then upped it to 20mg. Keep in mind, I am a 5’8 skinny white dude. I was spacing the medicine out every other day but two weeks ago I decided to take it back to back. Ever sense then, I’ve had crippling anxiety attacks. Making stuff up that isn’t even there, having to leave work early due to just not being there mentally and so on (Side note: I talked to my doctor about lowering the dosage and all. But to be honest, scares the shit out of me to even touch it) 

My girlfriend, we’ll call her Amelia. Amelia and I have been dating for about a month and a half and everything is going swimmingly well. But once these anxiety attacks started happening I started creating these nonexistent issues that weren’t even there. I started obsessing over things that didn’t need to be obsessed over. Amelia went to hang out with her coworker, we’ll call him George. George was showing Amelia a good time with his friends. Which is fine don’t get me wrong, but my mind took it to a place where it didn’t need to. Drove me nuts. Blew her phone up because I just needed to know what was happening. We talked it out and everything is cool now but ever sense that first really bad anxiety attack, they keep happening. I’m not sure if it’s side effects from the medication or me coming down from it or a combination of both or I’m just crazy. Typically driving at night helps and listening to music. I’ll call Amelia and we’ll talk it out but I just feel like I’m burdening her and I don’t want to do that. I’ve had anxiety before but NEVER this bad. These typically happen at night but sometimes during the day and it’s really random stuff that sets it off. I’m usually the “happy-go-lucky” guy but underneath the surface I can be a real hot mess. Amelia understands where I’m coming from and she’s incredibly patient with me and helps me work through it but I don’t want to burden her every time I’m having a bad night.

I recently got my first job for the summer and I’m afraid it’s been making me feel a lot worse. I’ve been experiencing anxiety before a shift and a night before work but leads me to stress and cry. 
Besides that, I’ve always been a person who cries. I am pretty emotional and super sensitive. It probably started in 7th grade, when I would get really sad and i didn’t know why. I didn’t know what to do so i started harming myself. Once my mom found it, she got mad and made me stop but she never consoled me or asked me what made me do that. In high school, it would continue. I would get stressed and sad for really minimal things. In college, it also occurred and I didn’t know what to do about it. I don’t really talk about it with anyone besides my boyfriend and a couple of friends but I always try to hold back because I don’t want to trouble anyone with my issues or annoy them because this is an issue I’ve been constantly facing.

My biggest anxiety fear is loss of control, IE suddenly becoming crazy, hurting someone or just going mad. It's what drives most of my anxiety in day to day existence.

I've been on Busperione for nearly a month. By the 3rd it will have been so. I started with 10 mg twice a day for a week, now up to 3 times a day so 30mg in total per day. I have all the lovely side effects, but the worst of all was that it's made my anxiety and panic feelings a lot worse, like I have a constant almost unyeilding nervous energy 22/5 which is far worse at night. It's very frustrating, not only because from what I read, Busperione usually has the least bad side effects (I'm unlucky and getting some of the more uncommon ones, like gastral upset, brain zaps, muscle spasms, confusion etc) but to have anxiety increase into a barely staved off panic attacks at least once a day really freaking sucks. I'm also working on a lot of exposure therapy and CBT and that's definitely poked a already very mad very scared bear.  
I read that this can happen and for many it was like a switch at some point in the month to six week mark that their anxiety when markedly down and they were doing much better. But right now, I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I won't quit, but I'm more angry, sad and scared than I've been in a long time. I hope you guys can share some insight on your experiences, especially those with very similar symptoms and mental disorder flavors like mine.  


I also recently read that you need to either eat, or not eat while taking the meds and stick to it.

t2_8n41rs2,"Needed to get this off my chest. I'm a medical doctor who graduated recently and I've been contemplating on taking the boards. The very thought of doing electives/observerships/being interviewed is kind of nerve-wracking! 

I've generally been a decent student throughout med school, studious, decent scores, never cheated, got through viva-voces quite without any hiccups. But the only thing that has bothered me the most was speaking out in public!
I've always been thoroughly terrified to give speeches/presentations in med school (but somehow managed it), but no matter how many times I try to overcome my stage fright and the anxiety, it just doesn't happen! I have sleepless nights weeks before my actual class presentation thinking of how I will be performing and how the audience is going to react. It's petrifying when I go out on the stage and my hands start trembling and I mess up the words and my mind completely  blanks out sometimes. I feel like I know very little about the topic and assume that the mediator will eventually laugh at my presentation. I feel like I have very low self-esteem and confidence levels and I've been trying to battle it since school.

I'm a medical doctor who graduated recently and I've been contemplating on taking the boards. The very thought of doing electives/observerships/being interviewed is kind of nerve-wracking! 

I've generally been a decent student throughout med school, studious, decent scores, never cheated, got through viva-voces quite without any hiccups. But the only thing that has bothered me the most was speaking out in public!
I've always been thoroughly terrified to give speeches/presentations in med school (but somehow managed it), but no matter how many times I try to overcome my stage fright and the anxiety, it just doesn't happen!

For the last few years, I have suffered with pretty bad anxiety. All of my anxious and obtrusive thoughts seem to be internally focused, I panic about losing control, losing my mind, losing touch with reality, becoming terminally ill, having a heart attack, dying, to name a few. None of the above has happened to me before.

I constantly worry about something bad will happen to me. This leads often to panic attacks, which usually include some pretty bad heart palpitations and a lot of nausea.

I also have pretty depressive thoughts, not thinking I'm good enough for anything, I deal with big insecurity issues and figuring it is better off if I am no longer alive. 

I have been taking many approaches to help with this, such as therapy and also some self care methods but nothing seems to be effective. My partner suggested that the next step is that I need to take medication.

I have never taken medication before for mental health issues. My GP has prescribed Setraline. 50MG, but for the first two weeks, starting with 25MG.

I have not yet taken it as I am absolutely terrified to do so. I feel taking medication is going to make me lose control, and my depressive and anxious thoughts will only get more intense, or else I could be subject to hallucinations or something that is going to make me lose touch with reality. 

I hyperventilate at the thought of taking the medication because I am just so anxious of what could happen. I find I just obsess too much with the side effects, no matter how uncommon they are. I don't know how the hell I can bring myself to take them.

Though staying feeling like this, the depressive thoughts and anxiety that is really ruining the quality of my life cannot continue.

Yesterday I went on a 30 min drive with my wife and kid out to a great hiking location we've enjoyed for years. I have anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and driving can often trigger those. On this drive I was not doing well. But holding it together. Usually upon arrival my mind and body relax quite a bit and I'm more free to enjoy the moment, but this time, for whatever reason, the struggle was much harder. 

The park is quite large and has winding roads throughout, and my kid began to meander into the road without looking, so in my parent voice I barked at him to watch both sides etc.

I’ve begun to become progressively more worried about my friend (F-18). Recently she’s been going through hell, following her breakup and her generally anxious personality. 

And this might be a bit far fetched, but she’s been drinking at nighttime. But I know she does enjoy drinking for the taste, it’s rosé. However, she’s stated it does take away from the stress and anxiety. I don’t think it’s a drinking addiction but at this point I don’t know for sure.

Additionally she is already on anxiety relieving pills, but these are only taken when necessary and not relied on.

Sorry just thought those would be helpful background, anyway onto the situation.

We talk a fair amount and I let her vent to me hoping it helps in some shape or form, and constantly remind her I’m here for her. Most of the time though it’s just casual conversation.

However, recently she’s admitted that’s shes been pushing me away. Saying that she hasn’t been explaining the full story. Whether or not this is about the breakup or another topic in general is a mystery to me. I’m going for the later though as we’ve never had trouble talking about her breakup. Following this I ofcourse reassured her that she shouldn’t feel forced to explain what she’s not comfortable with. But I’m becoming more worried as she said “trust if I’d ever do something stupid I’d seek help.” And yes I had to confirm she was talking about self harm. Now I realise she said she’d seek help, but that means the option of self harm or possibly worse has crossed her mind enough to mention that.

I know I can’t force her to tell me everything as that’s her choice. But I’m limited now, I can’t help her as she’s blocking me out and I’m becoming more and more worried thinking about it.

So what can I do to help her? I’m just lost and I want to help her, but am worried she’ll just continue to shut me out.

I’ve begun to become progressively more worried about my friend (F-18). Recently she’s been going through hell, following her breakup and her generally anxious personality. 

And this might be a bit far fetched, but she’s been drinking at nighttime. But I know she does enjoy drinking for the taste, it’s rosé. However, she’s stated it does take away from the stress and anxiety. I don’t think it’s a drinking addiction but at this point I don’t know for sure.

Additionally she is already on anxiety relieving pills, but these are only taken when necessary and not relied on.

Sorry just thought those would be helpful background, anyway onto the situation.

We talk a fair amount and I let her vent to me hoping it helps in some shape or form, and constantly remind her I’m here for her. Most of the time though it’s just casual conversation.

However, recently she’s admitted that’s shes been pushing me away. Saying that she hasn’t been explaining the full story. Whether or not this is about the breakup or another topic in general is a mystery to me. I’m going for the later though as we’ve never had trouble talking about her breakup. Following this I ofcourse reassured her that she shouldn’t feel forced to explain what she’s not comfortable with. But I’m becoming more worried as she said “trust if I’d ever do something stupid I’d seek help.” And yes I had to confirm she was talking about self harm. Now I realise she said she’d seek help, but that means the option of self harm or possibly worse has crossed her mind enough to mention that.

I know I can’t force her to tell me everything as that’s her choice. But I’m limited now, I can’t help her as she’s blocking me out and I’m becoming more and more worried thinking about it.

So what can I do to help her? I’m just lost and I want to help her, but am worried she’ll just continue to shut me out.

I'll keep the background short,

Parents and therapist are of the same religion (one of the biggest reasons I haven't been honest in my sessions).

* I don't want to wear the hijab, I plan on taking it off when I'm older.
* I'm bisexual, found out at 10.
* Attempted suicide via drowning in the bathtub during the middle of the night when I was 12.
* I have weak faith in religion. Tried praying and reading the Quran deep into the night so that I don't end up a disappointment to my family only to be left feeling more empty and alone. Was a waste of time and tears.
* Throughout ages 13 and 14 I would beat myself up whenever I got the house to myself.
* I'm preparing to be abandoned or disowned by my family when/if they find out some of the select items on this list.
* I know that my mother would kill me and my dad would shut down and become self destructive if they find out I'm not heterosexual.
* When I was 11-12 I was planning to run away because my mother hated me.
* I used to lie about most things when I was a kid and not for any specific reason, I just did.
* I distance myself from my friends as much as possible without losing their friendship.
* I cry myself to sleep roughly 3 nights of the week.
* I genuinely don't believe there's a future for me. The only reason I haven't ended it all is because, while it would be so much easier for myself, it would leave the family with a chaotic mess to deal with, and I don't think that's fair.

t2_xq2zi,"Hi everyone,

I haven't posted here before, but I could use a little advice or just encouragement after something that happened to me last night.

My boyfriend and I went to bed around 10pm and at 11:30pm our building's fire alarm went off. It is SO loud, maybe one of the loudest alarms I have ever heard. I don't to extremely well with loud noises, especially if they are unexpected.

I woke up screaming (not shrieking or anything, more like a loud ""ahhh"") and my boyfriend wanted to calm me, so he kind of slid on top of me and said ""the fire alarm is going off, we need to get out of the building"" as I kept screaming. At the time, I actually didn't realize I was screaming, which is why I was so alarmed that my boyfriend jumped on top of me and told me what was going on - because, yeah if you hear the fire alarm go off, that is what you do. I told my boyfriend later I was confused why he reacted that way and he told me he was trying to calm me because I was screaming.

Anyway, he helped me get out of bed and put a robe on. In less than 30 seconds we were outside and away from the building. We figured since we couldn't see or smell any smoke or fire, it was probably just set off by someone burning food or something. We stood outside for 10-15 minutes, and were able to go back inside.

I had a lot of trouble falling asleep last night. I'm usually a good sleeper, unless I am feeling anxious, then my brain tends to either want me to deeply analyze something random (for example: listing everything we have in the fridge over and over) or repeating the same thoughts over and over. Today, I have been shaking all morning and feeling extremely uneasy.

As someone who has suffered from anxiety much of my life, I know it can often be illogical, but still I feel silly being so shaken up from a simple fire alarm. I think it was just the first 10 seconds of being awoken suddenly by the alarm, my own screaming reaction, and my boyfriend's reaction to my screaming. It was a very unexpectedly traumatic and I don't know what to do about it right at this moment.

Has anyone experienced something like this?

Also, I want to note that I do see a therapist and will speak to them about this at my next appointment. And I am not currently taking any medication, but I do have some medication I was previously prescribed - Buspirone... though it has never really reduced my anxiety noticeably.",Need a little help after fire alarm went off in the middle of the night,Anxiety,1,c7tjh6,False,"Hi everyone,

t2_3wdstd91,"1. *Stop stimulating the mind all the time!*

This is the most helpful tip I could possibly give to anyone struggling with anxiety. If you over stimulate your mind with games, television shows, movies, etc., you will for sure develop an over imaginative mind that doesn't take any instruction from you.


2. *If you are a highly inactive person then start consuming less food (very low!)*

Don't stuff your body with food constantly. That way you don't over burden your digestive system and cause lethargy to the body. The place where the digestive system is located is also the centre of anxiety. Any moment in the past where you experienced fear, it originated from the pit of the stomach. So loosen your stomach by deep belly breathing and consuming less food.


3. *Don't consume meat*

I could care less about the morality of eating meat but physiologically, eating meat is bad for your body. All herbivores have teeth that can cut and grind whereas carnivores can only perform cutting action. Also the length human alimentary canal is similar to herbivores than carnivores. This is because our body expects that the food we eat should be digested within a few hours. It takes enormous amount of energy for our digestive system to digest meat. Meat will take about 48 to 52 hours to pass through our system by which time it begins to rot in the digestive system producing excessive bacterial activity. Whereas if you consume fruits for instance, it will take about 3 hours to pass through the system and not much energy is expended digesting it.


4. *Do Yoga*

Yoga is not a flexibility exercise that one does every Sunday to help with backaches. The word yoga means union - uniting oneself with everything else around. Hatha Yoga aims at bringing balance to the body before bringing balance to the mind. It is difficult to control the mind with the mind. It will act crazy even after years of serious meditation. Yoga understands this problem and hence proposes to tame the grosser parts of the mind (the physical body) before proceeding to tame the mind. In India, serious disciples of yoga will practice Hatha yoga for 36 years before they move on to Dhyana or meditation. So if you are looking forward to take up any new practice for inner work, my suggestion would be to take up Yoga.",Few tips I would like to share that have helped me immensely to curb my anxiety.,Anxiety,0,c7tuhf,False,"1. *Stop stimulating the mind all the time!*

t2_3fb53eub,"Not exactly sure where to start, but over the past couple months I have been able to replace (about 10 years of)  Klonopin and Zoloft/Fluvoxamine with medical cannabis. I started with a 1:1 THC to CBD RSO oil and it was like a total miracle. I felt like I was actually enjoying life again and wanting to just do things and be happy instead of hiding at home all the time. My wife says I'm like a completely different person, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

So after a couple weeks and reading a lot online I decided to try smoking a bit. I got an indica that people recommended, and at first it was very intense, but ended up being like a ""mind opening"" positive experience that I would end up meditating and relaxing to. Last week though I had a very bad panic attack on the way to work (driving is my biggest problem, usually highways and being ""stuck"" at lights/trains/traffic) I ended up having to pull over in a neighborhood because I felt tingly and numb and like I was having a heart attack. Why do panic attacks always have to start in my left arm? I've realized the Klonopin has been stopping these full blown panic attacks, but I always still had this problem with over conscious / difficulty and need to swallow constantly, and feeling like I need to grab onto something to keep from falling or ""losing it"". I had an event coming up at work that was requiring a drive on the highway, and even though I had drove to the city a few weeks ago, after taking  a klonopin as needed, I was already setting myself up for failure on this drive.  

&amp;#x200B;

That night I drove home and I had more panic, but not as bad, and I decided to take a half day and drive to the event from home, avoiding the highway completely, bad I know. After this stressful few days I tried smoking my indica at night and was fine at first, but ended up getting the ""weed shakes"" real bad when trying to sleep, which is basically like a very bad panic attack, and they both compound each other. My whole body was shaking and twitching, teeth chattering, chest and heart felt extremely fluttery and like they were popping out and beating all messed up. I put on some warm clothes and played a game and it subsided, but my chest still hurt. It's now 3 days later and I still have this spot of tightness and like something is blocked in my left side of my chest. I feel some pressure, lack of strength, and lifting, clenching fist seems to make it worse. When I take a very deep breath it almost feels like there's an air bubble or something in there. Over the past few years I had gotten pretty serious with weight lifting, but right now I feel like any strenuous activity could be bad for my heart or something.   

&amp;#x200B;

I've had these kinds of things happen before, but usually doesn't go into the next day. Is this normal? It seems to be getting better now, but there's still ""something there"" and of course I'm worried about it. It really sucks that I felt like I was finally getting everything right and feeling the best I have in years, and now this is a huge step back. I realllly don't want to give up and just take Klonopin and other stuff again, I was starting to feel other bad side effects from years of taking them. I got a 15:1 CBD / THC oil that causes absolutely no high at all, and I really believe in this stuff, but I obviously did a little too much too soon and I hope I didn't like ruin everything. I also don't think I need to go to the hospital or anything, but I'm not completely sure if I should go get a checkup or what.

That night I drove home and I had more panic, but not as bad, and I decided to take a half day and drive to the event from home, avoiding the highway completely, bad I know. After this stressful few days I tried smoking my indica at night and was fine at first, but ended up getting the ""weed shakes"" real bad when trying to sleep, which is basically like a very bad panic attack, and they both compound each other. My whole body was shaking and twitching, teeth chattering, chest and heart felt extremely fluttery and like they were popping out and beating all messed up. I put on some warm clothes and played a game and it subsided, but my chest still hurt. It's now 3 days later and I still have this spot of tightness and like something is blocked in my left side of my chest. I feel some pressure, lack of strength, and lifting, clenching fist seems to make it worse. When I take a very deep breath it almost feels like there's an air bubble or something in there. Over the past few years I had gotten pretty serious with weight lifting, but right now I feel like any strenuous activity could be bad for my heart or something.   

&amp;#x200B;

I've had these kinds of things happen before, but usually doesn't go into the next day. Is this normal? It seems to be getting better now, but there's still ""something there"" and of course I'm worried about it. It really sucks that I felt like I was finally getting everything right and feeling the best I have in years, and now this is a huge step back. I realllly don't want to give up and just take Klonopin and other stuff again, I was starting to feel other bad side effects from years of taking them. I got a 15:1 CBD / THC oil that causes absolutely no high at all, and I really believe in this stuff, but I obviously did a little too much too soon and I hope I didn't like ruin everything. I also don't think I need to go to the hospital or anything, but I'm not completely sure if I should go get a checkup or what. Heart area feels uneasy,""fluttery"" and like it's not beating completely properly just while I'm typing all this. I'm only 37, eat fairly healthy and exercise a lot usually, but now I'm even scared to do that. Has anyone had anything like this happen before? I'm going to just try to let things go back to normal, not smoke and keep taking my CBD, just hoping this goes away soon.

t2_jyxzfca,"Sorry for the long post but I needed to vent a little.

I've struggled with anxiety for about 2 years now. I've lost a group of friends because of it, they were supportive of my situation, but everyone has their limits. And after me ignoring any contact from them and trying to distance me from all of them, they had enough. I've almost lost my career because of it, going to class was a nightmare for me. After my first anxiety attack while being in class I couldn't attend any classes anymore, and almost got expelled out of uni because of it (one of the few things I'm sure I want to do in my life is to follow this career). My parents are really supportive, but they just don't understand anything about mental health. They don't ""believe"" that therapists work and I'm afraid to even ask if I can go to one. I deleted all of my social media, I can't even like something without feeling like people are gonna judge me for it, let alone uploading even an old picture as a profile picture.

But I'm fed up with this shit. Fortunately, I have the luxury of living alone in another city away from my parents. Tomorrow I'm calling a therapist and setting up a session.  I'm gonna get a gym membership. I'm gonna call some old friends and talk about my situation, so that I have someone to rely on. If they don't it's fine, I'm gonna get through this, even if I'm alone. No matter how long it takes.

My situation is not the worst, I know that. I just wanted to vent a little and say thanks, this subreddit helped me to realize that I'm not alone in this. I sometimes read some posts in here of really strong people, and I cannot help but admire how strong some of you are.

It’s been 3 years since I’ve developed this. It all started one day at uni. Luckily I remember when and why it all started. Well I blushed in front of a friend (I didn’t even notice it) and he pointed at me saying “haha you turned bright red!” Since then I developed a phobia of blushing, and to this day, I feel extreme anxiety (I want to escape the social situation, I feel like I’m so uncomfortable and my face starts tingling) the overall sensation I feel is: extreme embarrassment. What I feel inside is 1000x worse than what people see on the outside. I might appear calm but I feel like shit on the inside. I don’t know how to explain the feeling I get, but it’s all about being uncomfortable on my skin, feeling hot and accelerated (super anxious) and it makes me want to interact with NO ONE because of this sensation.

So, I need your help on this: some stuff has happened but I want to focus on what’s happening right now. I started the gym. And I’m doing it for my overall wellness, physical and mental health. The thing is... the first day of course the fear began to appear “what if I turn red? The professor will think I’m attracted to him” and guess what happened: I turned so red, that I felt like my face was about to explode and the professor told me to lay down on the floor, because he thought my pressure was down (of course he doesn’t know it’s all about the phobia) I swear guys I’ve never felt so much heat on my face. For some reason, when I’m working out, and my heart is racing and I’m hot, it’s easier for the phobia to appear and the red face to make its appearance, why is that? Is it normal? I feel like all of my senses are accelerated and I feel so self conscious about myself, I don’t know how to explain it...

Today I went to the gym again, and this time there was another boy as a professor, and luckily I didn’t go all the way red like last time, but I did feel so uncomfortable on the inside when interacting with him. And on top of all, he stares right at me in the eyes and it makes me so uncomfortable! It didn’t happen to me before I developed this phobia. It’s like my mind is aware at every single situation like it’s under a threat, waiting for something to happen to make my face go red! It makes every situation super stressful because it’s like I’m waiting for something to happen, it’s like my mind acts paranoid in this situations. It’s really stressful for me.

I swear to you guys, this is ruining my life, I wasn’t like this a few years back. I feel like I have no control over this, that I may lose my mind. It’s so frustrating.

t2_2vux51og,"Okay there's some backstory to this and I'm in the midst of an anxiety attack, which tends to make me rambly so please bear with me 

TL;DR: scheduled for work after an issue with the planning app, I'm not in the country so can't work. This isn't the first time this happened so I feel extremely anxious and guilty about it.

The company I work for does their planning through their website or app. You fill in your availability a month early (so August availability has to be put in before July 5th) and they'll schedule you accordingly. There's no set amount of hours you'll work and you could get an email the day before that they scheduled you. This already doesn't work too well with my anxiety, bc I don't like the work and I need some time to adjust to the idea of it, but so far I've been able to cope. The only reason I haven't quit yet is bc they gave me a three day course to make sure I was able to do the basics of health care and if I quit before a specific amount of shifts, I have to pay back the cost of that. That's €900 I don't have. Discounts are available at other amounts of shifts and that's what I'm working towards.

HOWEVER. I've had several issues with the app/website. I've been scheduled when I had changed my availability but it apparently didn't come through, so I had to email them saying that I wasn't actually available on the planned shift. This has happened two times since I came to the company in February. 

Last month, I got a text from the planner saying that it was the 3rd and I needed to plan my availability. Having genuinely forgotten, I did so immediately. The next day I got another text that I really needed to file it or my regional manager would be in touch. I checked, my hours were in my app, so I guessed maybe it needed some time to adjust. For a week, I heard nothing. After that week, however, I got an irritated text that I STILL had not filed availability. Confused I texted back that I had in fact filed it, and it showed so in my app, but I told them I'd check on my laptop. But honestly, all my hours were there. To make sure, I filed everything again, and texted that to the planner. 

The next day I got a call from my regional manager. I was at school so it was a voicemail, but it basically told me I really needed to fucking file my availability or there would be consequences. I heard the voicemail after office hours, so I decided to call back the next day (help), but the next day was Saturday so my regional manager was not available. The dude I had on the phone told me my availability seemed fine, so it was left at that. 

Besides that, I've had a time where I forgot to chance availability and got scheduled. Emailed saying that and the planner was (understandably) annoyed, but changed it. All of this together makes me super anxious when it comes to the planning and contacting the planner, because it keeps happening and I feel like they might think it's an excuse and I just regularly freak out about the whole thing. 

So now for the current issue at hand: last week something in my personal plans changed and I suddenly had an opening to go on vacation. I booked the plane tickets and made SURE to change my availability at work. I did this on Tuesday and checked yesterday and everything seemed fine. I fly next Wednesday and I'm looking forward to it. Until I receive an email this morning that they scheduled me for Thursday. I'm out of the country on Thursday. I immediately freak out and send them an email telling about previous trouble with the app and that I changed my availability, but things went wrong and I am in fact NOT available that Thursday. I feel sick with anxiety and guilt over this, because I feel like this happens far too often for the few times I have worked since I was employed. 

I also reached out to my regional manager about this, explained the issues but also my feelings of stress and guilt about this, and that I wanted to quit as SOON as I hit the first discount goal. This will be end of August. I can't continue working for this company anymore, everytime I'm scheduled I start having anxiety attacks day in advance and this whole thing just tipped me over the edge.

I thought I had a pretty good grip on things lately but finances are a sure way to do my head in.  


I'm horrible at remembering to pay doctor bills etc... I remembered this morning that i hadn't checked in a long time so I made the mistake of looking. Or rather, had the sense to finally look before I screwed myself further.

I found out that i owe $2400 for a baby I haven't given birth to yet, that my insurance doesn't cover I guess. Apparently they charge ahead of time so that I can have the delivery paid for by the time baby arrives. Cute, lovely, nice. \*eye roll\*  
Then I realized I have a health benefits card with money to cover it.   


Plot twist, they suspended that card because I never provided receipts from 2017 and 2018 visits. Great. Lovely.   


Simply enough it turns out I just need to request the copies of the receipts from the 2 places and submit them and things \*should\* be fine, and at that point I guess I'll be able to use my benefits card to pay off this expensive ass babies birthday.  


You would think that knowing this would be enough to calm me down, that I have an answer, a solution, all hope is not lost, and yet I still feel my IBS kicking into high gear, my stomach is making horrible noises as well as I feel like I'm either going to cry or vomit and I'm not sure why I feel this way now that I know I can dig myself out of this hole.

t2_4hsuugok,"Hi,

This has been the worst year of my life. Anxiety and depression were very unfamiliar to me until some time last year. In my mid they couldn't just come on their own. There had a clear reason for them. I guess i was wrong. Going from doing quite well in school, with friends and life in general to finishing school with horrible grades and avoiding all social contact like the plague. Anxiety has caused me so much trouble I don't even know where to begin. 

I cant go anywhere without worrying myself sick thinking about everything that could go wrong. Will i embarrass myself? Will I be in an accident? Will i unknowingly piss someone off? Before leaving the house I have probably went through every single possible catastrophic scenario I can think of. It does not matter if I'm just walking ten minutes to the store and back, my anxiety is always there to ruin it. Can't see my friends without constantly wanting to go home as soon as possible without being rude.

My parents are semi-understanding. I go to a therapist once a week which they support but they don't really believe anxiety is as difficult to deal with as it can be. They mean well although they got more of a ""it can't be that bad, just ignore it"" attitude. I have learned that it's easier to say no to things that trigger anxiety to avoid it altogether instead of actually facing it. Although this works short-term it causes even more anxiety because if you're avoiding everything, how are you supposed to accomplish anything? I cannot remember the last time i did something i was really proud of. Feel like a burden to my family and friends, I don't contribute with anything.

University starts in a couple of days and I'm terrified. Terrified that my anxiety will get the upper hand and that i will be back at home feeling sorry for myself. I don't even know how many hours i have spent worrying about group projects and if i will be ""good"" enough.  My parents has set up a plan for my future but if nothing changes, there's no way I'm going to manage. I don't have a plan myself for the future nor does the future excite me very much. Feels like I'm stuck, going nowhere but maybe university will change that? If not i don't know what to do. Have not seen much improvement since i got help. Still worried and stressed out absolutely everything. Anxiety is the cause of so many sleepless nights. Im exhausted and tired of my situation.

I cannot remember the last time i did something i was really proud of. Feel like a burden to my family and friends, I don't contribute with anything.

University starts in a couple of days and I'm terrified. Terrified that my anxiety will get the upper hand and that i will be back at home feeling sorry for myself. I don't even know how many hours i have spent worrying about group projects and if i will be ""good"" enough.  My parents has set up a plan for my future but if nothing changes, there's no way I'm going to manage. I don't have a plan myself for the future nor does the future excite me very much. Feels like I'm stuck, going nowhere but maybe university will change that? If not i don't know what to do. Have not seen much improvement since i got help. Still worried and stressed out absolutely everything. Anxiety is the cause of so many sleepless nights. Im exhausted and tired of my situation.

t2_c6leako,"Hey all. I'm married to a wonderful woman who happens to suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. It's been a long road getting for her properly diagnosed, and I've got such respect for the battles she fights daily in her head, out of sight, but no less brutal and exhausting. This is NOT a vent post. My wife is a warrior fighting a ruthless enemy that knows all her weaknesses, and way more often than not she wins.

When her anxiety is bad, or she's having a panic attack, she can get very defensive, and will sometimes lash out and say some pretty nasty things to me in the heat of the moment. This isn't a regular occurance, but it happens sometimes. It can be tough for me because in the moment she sounds like she means what she says, even if I know she really doesn't and it's her anxiety talking. 

My question revolves around the fact that she often has no memory of having said these things once she's back to herself again. I remember them, but she doesn't. It creates a rough situation, because I hear what she says and it affects me, but she's devastated if I tell her what she's done and she feels awful for days.  For those reasons it can be hard for us to have a constructive conversation about it after the fact. 

So, folks with anxiety, if you could help an ally out, I'd like to understand what's going on a little better. Have you experienced something similar? Have you said or done things you didn't remember after? Can you give me any insight from the point of view of the person with anxiety?

If I can understand this better, I can support my wife better. She's an amazing wife and mother, and deserves everything I can give her. My thanks to you all, and much respect for what you go through.

t2_4b22vfg2,"I have multiple friends with anxiety (two with GAD, one with hypochondria, one with social anxiety and one with panic disorder), so I generally know how to help people with anxiety in different situations. If they need it, I let them be, help them breath, talk the trigger out or try to defeat the trigger. But the thing is, I only helped with triggers outside of me. Now, one of my friend is anxious of our friendship and I don't know what should I do.

Now, I know that I am not a therapist, and I don't want to ""fix"" her problem, nor do I think that I should help every anxious friend every time. But I also think that since ""I am"" the trigger, it does matter how I behave in this situation. 

The backstory: me and this friend lived together for 1,5 years in a dorm, as roommates. But it got the the point, where we started to argue a lot. Not serious things, we can always resolve them, that is not the problem. The problem is that we hung around each other a lot, since we go to the same university also, have most of our classes together. And I suggested that we change roommates (since we cant change our courses), so we don't spend every day together, because that may help the situation. If we only spend half a day together, we can cool down a bit because we would have our own space. I was happy to change roommates, because I think it is a really great opportunity to learn more about living together with others, and but she only ever lived with me in a dorm, has way less experience in a dorm, so she is really anxious. I told her after 1-2 month she would get used to the new people.

But recently she told me she is way more anxious about me, because she thinks that I don't need her as much as she needs me, and I don't like her company as much as she likes mine, and I like the new people more than her. I KNOW that it's her anxiety speaking and she is really not that self-centered. But I don't know how to react. Because I think it would reassure her if we spend a lit of time together during the first months, so she knows I value our friendship, but also I want to give each other more space, since that is why we decided to move into separate rooms. We would see each other at school every day, so we would meet up, but I think she needs way more quality time together than me, and that is not because I don't like her, but because I enjoy my hobbies alone a lot. And I also want both of us to get to know our new roommates. I really think she is taking this as a rejection because of her anxiety.

Do you have any suggestions? How do I reassure her? It is really a bad situation, because I feel like I am in control, and she is not. I forced her to move rooms, she didn't want to. I don't want to meet that often, she would like to. My desires will be met, but hers won't, and I don't like this position.

but today is my birthday. and i really wanted to be happy and not think of anything. is been really stressful for me for the past few months. yesterday i planned that today, im just gonna chill and not think. and i had some stuff to do yesterday and didnt feel like it but i force myself to do it so i would feel accomplished and not think about it today.

t2_3k5d7k3z,"Hello, I'm not sure if this will fit here but I'm at my wits end and not sure where to turn. Sorry if this is a mess, I'm writing this through tears,

Im saving up for counselling but it will be a while before I can afford it.

A few months ago I went through drug withdrawal and with that came a slew of nasty symptoms. It was hell.  It heightened my anxiety and it doesn't seem to have gone back down. There was a few weeks where I had horrible insomnia as well. During the insomnia, I set myself a strict bedtime of 10pm, so that way I'd have a lot of time to try and squeeze some hours out of the night.

All the symptoms have come to pass, but Im left with some issues still - namely anxiety about sleep. 

I have gotten to a point where I can sleep for a solid 8 hours but only if I go to bed at or before 9:30-10pm. If I stay up later than this, my body starts to go into panic mode, thinking that I wont sleep, I don't have enough hours to sleep, and that I'm screwed for the next day until 9:30 when I can try to sleep again.

I start to feel very tired/groggy around 9 but if I stay up that feeling goes away? I've tried pushing my limits but I end up having a hard time falling asleep and it's very fragmented and short (4 hours).

I know I don't have any diagnosed sleeping problems, when I am able to get into bed at my proffered times everything goes fine.

But I feel like I've lost the ability to stay up? Or have any fluidity in my sleep schedule. This scares me because it fits my current lifestyle now but what if I have to change it? (I know in life I'll have to stay awake and sleep at weird times sometimes). I miss being able to stay awake and go out with friends, but since all this happened I haven't done anything fun after 8pm to ensure I am home and able to be in bed.

I never ever had a problem with this before, sleep was something I just did and never thought twice about, but now it's on my mind constantly. I watch the time like a hawk and as I see the numbers tick past the more nervous I get.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before?

He would have went into the side of me if we both didn't slam our brakes on. We just stared at each other and I thought he was going to apologise, but he started mouthing off instead. I told him to fuck off, stuck my middle finger up at him and drove off.

t2_4gvua27q,"I've had this problem for a long time and it's frustrating. Can anyone relate. I am sure it has its roots deep in social anxiety.

Honestly, I wear pretty sloppy clothes to work and I'm not very happy with my hairstyle either, but I am too afraid to change it. This deeply affects my confidence as I feel like a slob yet I don't want to draw attention to myself by wearing a different style of clothes, I often hide out in my office where I won't be seen. It has even gotten to the point where I wear jackets/fleece/pullovers over my everyday clothes because I hate my current wardrobe and making an excuse like ""I'm cold"", yet I gain some sort of comfort by covering up how ""bad"" I look. 

I am OK with how my body looks and I think I'm a fairly attractive person so it's not that. I guess I'm just afraid of drawing attention to myself or having people think ""Oh she's dressing differently"" or ""She has all new clothes now and a different style"" even though I doubt anyone would give a shit to think any of that. 

I looked online and found a lot of outfits I would love to wear. A chambray shirt, an olive cardigan. Black jeans! All stuff I would feel very good and even sexy/confident wearing out in public like to Target or the movies. All stuff that would look put together and classy at work, too. If I ran into a coworker there, I wouldn't care. But for some damn reason if I imagine wearing these clothes to the office I panic and I can't and I end up going back to my old sloppy wardrobe. 

Has anyone experienced these feelings before? How do I get over it? I'm thinking of wearing one article of new clothing to work every day to kind of ease into it, but a lot of ""new"" things I wear only look good when I wear the entire ensemble. I feel a bit shallow making such a huge deal out of clothing but this issue has really affected my self confidence. 

I was promoted recently and start a brand new job next week (well, internal transfer to a new office and everything) and I want to start off on a fresh new foot and being more confident and free to wear what I want, because I feel like if I don't start wearing what I like now, I never will.",Afraid to wear new clothes or a new hairstyle around people I know (esp. at work).,Anxiety,21,cybms7,False,"I've had this problem for a long time and it's frustrating.

This deeply affects my confidence as I feel like a slob yet I don't want to draw attention to myself by wearing a different style of clothes, I often hide out in my office where I won't be seen. It has even gotten to the point where I wear jackets/fleece/pullovers over my everyday clothes because I hate my current wardrobe and making an excuse like ""I'm cold"", yet I gain some sort of comfort by covering up how ""bad"" I look. 

I am OK with how my body looks and I think I'm a fairly attractive person so it's not that. I guess I'm just afraid of drawing attention to myself or having people think ""Oh she's dressing differently"" or ""She has all new clothes now and a different style"" even though I doubt anyone would give a shit to think any of that. 

I looked online and found a lot of outfits I would love to wear. A chambray shirt, an olive cardigan. Black jeans! All stuff I would feel very good and even sexy/confident wearing out in public like to Target or the movies. All stuff that would look put together and classy at work, too. If I ran into a coworker there, I wouldn't care. But for some damn reason if I imagine wearing these clothes to the office I panic and I can't and I end up going back to my old sloppy wardrobe. 

Has anyone experienced these feelings before? How do I get over it? I'm thinking of wearing one article of new clothing to work every day to kind of ease into it, but a lot of ""new"" things I wear only look good when I wear the entire ensemble. I feel a bit shallow making such a huge deal out of clothing but this issue has really affected my self confidence. 

I was promoted recently and start a brand new job next week (well, internal transfer to a new office and everything) and I want to start off on a fresh new foot and being more confident and free to wear what I want, because I feel like if I don't start wearing what I like now, I never will. Afraid to wear new clothes or a new hairstyle around people I know (esp. at work).",416,16,432,0.086,0.724,0.189,0.995

t2_35asc889,"23F, here. This post is really long, I'm sorry. TW for mention of suicide. 

My whole life I have had debilitating anxiety and depression. I almost didn't graduate high school, and was told to stay away from college because of my inability to handle a lot at once. I thought I'd try it anyways, as I believed in myself at the time. I have almost graduated, with this fifth year being my last. I can only handle about 12 credits each semester (you need 16 about every semester to graduate in four years), I have been beating myself up about the fifth year but I am pretty proud of myself that I am at the home stretch. I spend about two hours getting up, trying to call myself down for the day, It's a struggle every single morning, that I have to converse with people, that I have to have trust in myself, and usually I can overcome it. Going to classes is a lot for me to handle. When I come home, I am very exhausted, and playing video games and shutting myself in my room helps me heal, which I think is more because I am an introvert. I don't have many friends because I don't go to parties or any social gatherings, and I am okay with that. This is embarrassing to say, but I've never worked a job. School has been already enough for me to handle and I can't add anything more on to my life, unless I need to. Once school ends, I will look for jobs. My ""job"" right now is doing art commissions, which has helped me some. 

Despite of everything I struggle with, I have been able to maintain As and Bs in my classes. I should be proud of myself and I try to be. In high school I would have never dreamed of this. 

Recently in the past seven months I have been in a bad depression, because of my anxiety. I've considered suicide many times. I get so many panic attacks about the next day that I want to end myself do I don't have to handle the next day. 

I told my roommate I was very depressed. She proceeded to tell me that she also has had depression and anxiety and she understands what it's like, which helped me. But then she started giving me this pep talk. She thinks that I'm not using ""my full potential"" and doing more things will help my anxiety and depression. She says that ""you need to push yourself to do things that will give you responsibility and higher self-esteem"" and that ""you need to get a job because you are avoiding it and it will hurt you later in life"". She says that I lock myself in my room and I'm not helping myself. That I'm not going out there and ""doing successful things"". 

Is she correct? She is an amazing person and I trust what she says, but if it's true, I don't think I can live with myself. I am trying so hard right now. I can't believe I'm not pushing myself. I hate this. I know I'm not as successful as other people and I try to not let that effect my self esteem but right now it's tearing me apart.",My roommate had a pep talk with me and I feel horrible,Anxiety,5,cyddi5,False,"23F, here.

t2_177v57nx,"I know how hard it can be to get out of bed. When the anxiety keeps you up at night, and by the time you fall asleep it's already time to get up for the day soon. So you start the day with a panic attack. Or crying. Or thinking you can't do it. And all the better and easier choice would be to stay in bed and deal with your anxiety away from the pressures of life.

But sometimes life hands us these deals, so that we can prove to ourselves how damn resilient we are! You got up today. You're reading this post. To me, that signifies you've already got that strength in you. Keep pushing and keep fighting it.

For me, anxiety is the constant battle in my head. I know what I think is irrational, and most likely is not going to happen in that terrible outcome. My brain and my heart know this. But that anxiety creeps up and shuts it down. Builds pressure up into my chest till I can't breathe. Tells me it will be that bad. That it'll definitely turn out crappy.

But over the years, I've have tried to remind myself, since when has attempting to think positively ever harmed anything? Try to think of all the times when your anxiety got to you. You assume the day is going to start bad. Then of course you'll see every little tiny thing that happens as something negative or that the world is out to get you. But it really isn't. Even when I struggle to come up with a positive thought, I'll try to think of something completely random and strange, so that my train of thought doesn't spiral down the negativity rabbit hole. So maybe that will work for you! 

And remember, we all know how lonely it can feel. That no one understands you. But I promise you there are others struggling the same as you and we have the strength &amp; power to battle through it. Remember that even where you feel you don't have support or it isn't received in the way you want, that those offering support are doing so in the ways that they know how to comfort. Even when I think my friends aren't worrying about me or they don't contact me after a few days, sometimes people just don't know you are struggling unless you let them know. And I know it's hard to open up. But I've found people are a lot more receptive than you'd make them out to be..

Either way, I want you to know that you are doing you're absolute best, the universe sees all you are doing, and I promise good blessings are coming your way. In the dark, it's hard to see them. But I can feel it today. Today is your new start, new month, new you, your day to send that text, make that call, tell that person you love them, hug your friends and family, go after that job you want, pick up that dusty book you've been meaning to read, take a nice walk and get fresh air. There's so many small blessings and light in every day life that we miss during our struggles.

And this is a reminder that you are all that light. I see how every one of you loves, supports and respects everyone in your life and this community. So if I have no reason to get out of bed today, all of you are those blessings &amp; light, and *you* are *ALL* the reason I'm getting out of bed today.

t2_c5a7rpc,"*TL;DR: I’m trying to fix posture, but that requires being aware of my body. Being aware of my body triggers my subconscious body anxiety, and I’m having massive tension problems because of it. How can I do one but avoid the other?*

Here’s the gist of it:

-	I’m trying to fix forward head posture and rolled shoulders
-	I’ve been having horrible every day tension in my shoulders and upper back. It happens for weeks sometimes, or sometimes just a day or two. It leads to headaches, sometimes migraines.
-	I have bad body/health anxiety

There’s tons of variables to consider, but I think the pain problem is caused by my anxiety. Here’s why:

-	Sometimes the tension will go away for a long periods (weeks, even) despite me doing the exact same things.
-	I have a bad habit of obsessing over my body when I’m trying to fix something (fixing posture every five seconds, forcing movements, getting frustrated, etc.). This is partly my ADHD, I’m guessing. 
-	I am incapable of relaxing when this happens. I sit on the couch and instantly feel tension and cannot let myself “sink into the couch” no matter what. Same with chairs, sometimes standing.
-	If I get frustrated or depressed and give up, the tension often goes away while I mope around and zone out/lie down. 
-	It’s near-impossible to stop once it starts. I think this is me looping into myself (anxiety causes tension, tension causes anxiety, etc.). It does, however, go away sometimes when I’m very stimulated/distracted. 
-	I feel like the tension basically ruins my life when it happens, especially since I immediately anticipate it swelling/the headache, and it kills entire day’s easily.
-	My physiotherapist and masseuse don’t seem to understand what I’m talking about it when I tell them how fast the tension kicks in when I try to sit or the like. They just tell me to keep working on posture and to “try and move positions often” (but it happens with seconds sometimes).
-	When I meditated today, and the app told me to feel the gravity pulling me, the tension melted away (at least temporarily). 
-	Even when I play a game or watch a show, it feels like half my mind is gripping my body. 

So. I’m pretty sure it’s anxiety.

In my early to mid teens I had pretty aggressive social anxiety which I have little to no amount of right now. I consider myself pretty social and to be honest with you, I kinda hate being alone. Opposite to my early teens where I never wanted to leave the house or converse with others because of said SA.

This is all pretty much besides the point, my anxiety devolved into almost a hypochondriac/ocd type. Right now I fear that I am slowly losing my mind, like I'm developing schizophrenia. Let me give you more detail.

Three months ago I dropped acid for my first time. I was never a big drug user having only smoked weed a quite low amount of times. Acid is something that was always on my bucket list, and my long time friend just happened to be dealing so I kinda just jumped on the occasion. (The LSD was tested and real.) My trip was pretty alright, I had a mini panic attack towards the end thinking I would never come down and that I was stuck in that state forever. 

I had anxiety pretty bad the weeks after. My eyes weren't playing tricks on me or anything just total fear of developing HPPD or never returning to being a normal person. Thinking back on it I felt pretty normal about a month after. Until I decided, stupidly, to smoke weed again. 

I had a panic attack that wasn't too obvious to my friends, but my mind was running in circles, I don't remember what I was thinking exactly just that I was fucking scared wholeheartedly that I'd never be normal again. I'd never return to being me again.

I had a pretty rough day after. Having only slept four hours on my friends couch and needing to go to work a couple hours later. Only now something changed. I drove to work and I would periodically have my mind play tricks on me. I thought I had finally done it. Break my connection to reality. Break my sanity. Ironically I did get it off my mind during the day at work but once I started driving back home I started noticing it again!

Driving used to be my therapy. Where I can listen to music and drive down the pretty streets of my hometown and enjoy the scenery, now devolved into ""Am I about to get a trashcan confused with a person walking down a street again?""

The anxiety has gotten so bad lately I even have started to question every sound I hear. I'd hear a plane fly overhead and ask myself if I am just hearing stuff. Only to take my headset off and hear it and confirm that, of course, it was real. I even mentioned it to my sister just to be absolutely sure. 

""Did you hear that plane fly by? It was loud as hell, huh?""

""Yeah it sounds like they're flying really low!""

Some nights I'd get so scared of losing control and genuinely believing that one morning I will be waking up a full blown schizo.

This week has been especially hard for me because I thought for a couple days that my crazy aunt had schizophrenia as well and that it's genetic and that it's going to get me as well. This is what's been fueling my anxiety the past week. I finally worked up the courage this morning to ask my dad about it before going to work. He told me that she hasn't 'been all there' since she got hit by a car in her teens. Meaning that whatever mental disability she has was environmental and not genetic. Other than this aunt, my family has no history of mental disorders. And to go back on the drug related parts of the story, I am very confident that I'd be fine today if I hadn't chose to smoke weed after previously having LSD induced anxiety. Because like I said before my LSD induced anxiety was pretty much faded away up until I smoked weed. It revived it and made it worse, I finally realized that my brain doesn't agree with THC. And if I can take back the fact I dropped acid and smoked weed I most certainly would. I really enjoyed my experience with acid but that mental torment caused by anxiety just was not worth it.

This week has been especially hard for me because I thought for a couple days that my crazy aunt had schizophrenia as well and that it's genetic and that it's going to get me as well. This is what's been fueling my anxiety the past week. I finally worked up the courage this morning to ask my dad about it before going to work. He told me that she hasn't 'been all there' since she got hit by a car in her teens. Meaning that whatever mental disability she has was environmental and not genetic. Other than this aunt, my family has no history of mental disorders. And to go back on the drug related parts of the story, I am very confident that I'd be fine today if I hadn't chose to smoke weed after previously having LSD induced anxiety. Because like I said before my LSD induced anxiety was pretty much faded away up until I smoked weed. It revived it and made it worse, I finally realized that my brain doesn't agree with THC. And if I can take back the fact I dropped acid and smoked weed I most certainly would. I really enjoyed my experience with acid but that mental torment caused by anxiety just was not worth it.

I just need some tips from people who were once in a position similar to mine. Should I be worried? Worried about a certain mental illness...",767,6,773,0.117,0.774,0.109,0.7861

First a bit of background. Last year of university I had a traumatic experience that developed into episodes of debilitating depression and anxiety, to the point of being scared to leave the house.

t2_1xbii6gt,"Hello friends,

Freaking out typing this post :/

Previously (April-May) had been on Lorazepam and desvenlafaxine for lack of sleep and what I believe to be anxiety and panic attacks related to poor sleep. Didn't mind lorazepam but desvenlafaxine was not very good for me (felt like I could fall over the crazy ledge any time), I quit cold turkey after a month (desvenlafaxine 50mg low dose) and even with a low dose suffered the consequences for a week (felt like my brain was connected to a 9v battery). I don't even know why the heck I was prescribed desvenlafaxine for panic attacks and anxiety but I had enough of it and this fixing the underlying cause BS after this.

Thought I was over it all, I was making sure to let the triggers get me, but something I can't control is sleep. Worked late till 4AM (not forced or anything, I just zoned out and was in the flow) 2 days ago and it has been all downhill from there.

Freaking out typing this post :/

Previously (April-May) had been on Lorazepam and desvenlafaxine for lack of sleep and what I believe to be anxiety and panic attacks related to poor sleep. Didn't mind lorazepam but desvenlafaxine was not very good for me (felt like I could fall over the crazy ledge any time), I quit cold turkey after a month (desvenlafaxine 50mg low dose) and even with a low dose suffered the consequences for a week (felt like my brain was connected to a 9v battery). I don't even know why the heck I was prescribed desvenlafaxine for panic attacks and anxiety but I had enough of it and this fixing the underlying cause BS after this.

Thought I was over it all, I was making sure to let the triggers get me, but something I can't control is sleep. Worked late till 4AM (not forced or anything, I just zoned out and was in the flow) 2 days ago and it has been all downhill from there. No sleep on first night and severe panic attacks on second night. Saw doc today morning first thing and he prescribed lorazepam and risperidone.

t2_2hhdktc7,"TLDR: anxiety holding me back at uni, I’m not making any friends. My parents think I am loving it, and I don’t want to upset them by telling them that I’m missing out.

I just arrived at university on Saturday, and I am really struggling. I’m living in a college, so I share a kitchen with 5 other flatmates in our corridor. This is situated in a block (which has multiple corridors) - there are three blocks in the college itself. 

A bit of background - I used to be quite social at school, but my best friend treated me like shit, so I isolated myself and stopped talking to anyone. I walked around with earbuds in. I became very anxious, thinking that people hated me, and I only really had one or two friends that I talked to. I skipped on lunch and so never had the energy to play sport and develop friendships through that. I survived until the end of school, did alright in my exams and now I’m at university.

Over the summer my anxiety got better - I worked a job on a maintenance team for a school, and gradually I opened up and got better at talking. However, I arrived at uni and all the anxiety has come back. My flatmates are alright, but most only care about partying, getting drunk/high, which is fine, but I don’t enjoy that. The college has arranged events to go to, but I only went to one, a board games night. I have mostly just sat in my flat on my own all day, or slept to avoid having to go to the kitchen to eat. I am too nervous to talk to anyone. There is another person in my corridor who is quiet like me - I’ve tried talking to him, but I don’t think he likes me. There’s a girl that always arranges to go to events with him - I like her, she seems nice but they never ask me.

The thing is, my parents have been contacting me asking if I’m enjoying it and what I’ve been up to. I told them that I was going to go to this massive dinner that they have planned for us tonight. However it’s an 8 hour ordeal involving drinking and dancing and I really don’t want to go. My parents know that I struggled at school but they think that I’m going to have the time of my life, but I think it’ll end up being the same as at school. They’re already missing me so much and I don’t want to pile onto that by telling them that I’m missing out on everything and not making any friends.

Has anyone been through something similar? Does anyone have any advice? I’m sorry for the wall of text but I just hope someone can help me. Honestly I don’t even know if I have anxiety or not.

I just arrived at university on Saturday, and I am really struggling. I’m living in a college, so I share a kitchen with 5 other flatmates in our corridor. This is situated in a block (which has multiple corridors) - there are three blocks in the college itself. 

A bit of background - I used to be quite social at school, but my best friend treated me like shit, so I isolated myself and stopped talking to anyone. I walked around with earbuds in. I became very anxious, thinking that people hated me, and I only really had one or two friends that I talked to. I skipped on lunch and so never had the energy to play sport and develop friendships through that. I survived until the end of school, did alright in my exams and now I’m at university.

Over the summer my anxiety got better - I worked a job on a maintenance team for a school, and gradually I opened up and got better at talking. However, I arrived at uni and all the anxiety has come back. My flatmates are alright, but most only care about partying, getting drunk/high, which is fine, but I don’t enjoy that. The college has arranged events to go to, but I only went to one, a board games night. I have mostly just sat in my flat on my own all day, or slept to avoid having to go to the kitchen to eat. I am too nervous to talk to anyone. There is another person in my corridor who is quiet like me - I’ve tried talking to him, but I don’t think he likes me. There’s a girl that always arranges to go to events with him - I like her, she seems nice but they never ask me.

The thing is, my parents have been contacting me asking if I’m enjoying it and what I’ve been up to. I told them that I was going to go to this massive dinner that they have planned for us tonight. However it’s an 8 hour ordeal involving drinking and dancing and I really don’t want to go. My parents know that I struggled at school but they think that I’m going to have the time of my life, but I think it’ll end up being the same as at school. They’re already missing me so much and I don’t want to pile onto that by telling them that I’m missing out on everything and not making any friends.

Has anyone been through something similar? Does anyone have any advice? I’m sorry for the wall of text but I just hope someone can help me. Honestly I don’t even know if I have anxiety or not. I haven’t been diagnosed and at first I thought I had depression but I don’t know if I do now. Oh well. Any advice would be much appreciated.

I've always been a nervous and overthinking person but my ex-boyfriend cheating on me and leading me on for months after that led not only to a crippling heartache but also to my often present anxiety. I guess I'm ""high-functioning"", I can work, have many social contacts and a fairly good life. But there's always an anxious beast within me. 

I've been in a new relationship for some time and a dearly love my new BF. I'm over my ex and never want him back. We are mostly no contact but he still tries to contact me every few months or so. I realized that while I rarely think about him in my day to day life and don't miss him at all when he contacts me it really triggers my anxiety. He's like an evil that must never harm me again and I could never talk to him calmly and rational.

t2_azddh,"I'm too worried about my friend. They told me some pretty scary stuff last week, and just.. I'm worried. They're becoming withdrawn. At the moment, I'm trying to give them space, because they're not feeling ok. And they asked for some space.

It's hard for me because we used to talk daily about a lot of things, even when they've not been feeling very social, and I've started to look forward to our conversations. Expecting them? Which is probably too much, and not.. I don't know, good? 

I just keep thinking that I specifically did something wrong, when I know I probably didn't. I keep thinking I lost them as a friend or they're dead, I keep obsessing over it. Even though I know I'm probably wrong.

I have generalized anxiety, though, I've been thinking maybe it's something else. A misdiagnosis, but I don't know. Something more intense than generalized anxiety? Can't afford a doctor or therapist to find out.

I can't sleep at night. When I'm awake, I have daily panic attacks, mini ones throughout the day. I'm an artist, and I can hardly hold a pencil because my hands are shaking too much.

There's more than the friend worry, but that's what's being loud right now. I just want them to feel okay. Because, while everyone's situation is different, I know what it's like to want to die, to withdraw and not talk to anyone. I'm going through similar feelings. It's not good. I just, I want to help. But I can't help if they don't talk to me.

I offered my help, and I feel really bad because of my personal reaction. I didn't know that I would start to obsess over thoughts that aren't true. Thoughts like, ""oh they died because they didn't react to the meme you sent them"" and ""oh they must hate you, because you're annoying."" 

I absolutely know not everything is about me, and I hate that my anxiety won't let me feel otherwise. 

I thought I had a handle on my anxiety, that I knew how to ride it out. My friend is going through some hard shit, and they shouldn't have to feel like they're doing something wrong by sharing that with me. I feel horrible about my reaction, even though I'm suffering in secret.

I'm not going to tell them what I'm going through, because that would make them feel worse, and probably make them keep their feelings bottled up until they're at their own breaking point.

I offered my help, and that should be enough, the torch is in their hand, so to speak. But I just. I'm so scared. About a lot of things. More than just my friend worry. I don't know what to do.

I wish I could stop thinking they've died. Or that they hate me. Or that I said something wrong. When I know it's absolutely not true.

I am the eldest of 3. We are all in our 20’s. I seem to spend the majority of my life worrying about my siblings, parents and my husband. I worry about something bad happening to them, the choices they make and if they’re happy. For example my brother has recently split with his long term girlfriend and I spend nights wide awake wondering if he is going to start doing drugs/that he is drinking too much/that he isn’t eating well. He has been going out every night till the early morning and I worry about him being involved in an accident etc.  He is very easily influenced and I appreciate that I can’t stop him as he has his own choices to make but I can’t stop worrying about him messing his life up. I try not to talk to him  about it as it’s not my life. He isn’t coping with the end of the relationship and I feel at a total loss of how to help him.

I worry about my sister and her relationship as they argue a fair amount, and she has left him a few times and been really unhappy as she realises that what they argue about is not worth ending the relationship and so goes back to him. I feel like I’m constantly  waiting for something to happen-that they will split up. They are quite temperamental and act in haste. Again, I know I can’t stop them doing that but I end up picking up the pieces and I think it’s affecting me more than I thought but I can’t stop worrying about them. She will text/call me when they have a row and need lots of help but won’t answer me if I enquire to how they are doing-and she always has her phone on her. She can also be quite horrible with her temper towards me if I don’t say the right thing and I struggle with this a lot as it makes me so anxious to think I’ve upset her. 

I worry about my mum having health problems-because she always worries about getting a terminal disease and will panic every time she is ill. She is extremely scared of dying and I worry about her dying too as I know how terrified she is of it. I worry constantly that I’m doing something that would disappoint or annoy my dad-my siblings have this wonderful relationship with my parents where they can tell them anything but I can’t. I used to be able to tell my mum stuff but she used to tell people about it and I’m now so scared of being judged by others I can’t open up. 

I worry about my husband-who has to put up with me. I feel like I’m carrying the weight of everyone else on my shoulders and I don’t want to do this. He is amazingly supportive of me and shouldn’t have to be. I wish I was normal. They don’t put it on me, it’s all self-inflicted. Has anyone got any advice? It’s ruining my life.

TL;DR - anxiety has gotten unmanageable again and I'm having trouble coping 

So, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and GAD when I was 13 (9 years ago)...I ""managed"" (suffered through) it for nearly 7 years with no medication, until I was prescribed an antidepressant (Trintellix) and xanax for panic attacks. 

I've had two periods in my life where I have been panic attack free. Once from 16 - 17, and about a month ago, I was approaching my second month with no panic attacks and a good maintenance of daily anxiety...

Then, life happened. Two weeks ago. And it's been hell ever since.

I am a college student (senior), and my academic advisors fucked me over and after being recently told I was set to graduate this spring, I was told I am short credits and need to stay for an extra semester. School is my biggest stressor, so this really threw me for a loop and made me lose my mind. Two days later, my pet dies of old age and pneumonia. One week later, my friend visits for my birthday and I am not left alone for a single second (I love my friend, but she was staying at my place for a week and it was extremely claustrophobic - especially because I was still processing the events of the prior week). 

Because of my increased anxiety, I've increased how often I take xanax (I used to only take it once or twice a week, I'm taking it almost every day now) and I've now run out of pills and my insurance won't let me fill a new prescription (that I got from my doctor, with a new dose) until October 15th. 

My panic attacks are very physically violent - they include me hyperventilating to the point of almost passing out and/or forceful vomiting. I had three of these attacks yesterday morning at school...each lasting over an hour. 

I am waking up having panic attacks now, every single day - without fail...and nothing I do seems to stop them....they're getting longer, stronger, and overall, worse. My anxiety has made me mildly agoraphobic, so I can't even make it to my therapists office and have to keep cancelling my appointments with her. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to turn. I don't know how to function. I don't know when this will pass, if it will ever pass, but I feel so exhausted and defeated right now that I can barely leave my bed. I've thankfully been keeping down water, but in the past 2 weeks I've had maybe 4 full meals that I was able to keep down.

t2_3eywp37d," How are you!!! How are you doing!! People usually ask me whenever I am meeting with them. Well physically I am doing fine but I am emotionally mentally not feeling well.  

People are reluctant to understand that Mental Health is a Real important factor for well being.

Mental Wellbeing includes our emotional psychological and social wellbeing. It affects our daily life. Being not mentally well affects our choice and decision making.  Mental distress, anxiety, depression all these are REAL not just Medical fantasy Terms.

Abusive and discouragement treatment within the family during my childhood are main contributed factors for my mental health issues.  Beating kids or spanking kids is the common socially accepted parenting trait. Parents often admit that they have no other choice but to use force to discipline their kids. Well in my case I was never been demanding spoiled kid. Even today my parents agree on this matter.

So why did they beat me!! The answer lies in our competitive school exam systems. Our society is kind of obsessed with school grades, people are literally giving their judgemental remarks about the kids on the base of school grades. Kids often face discriminatory treatment because of school grades. If you have great school grades then people give you special attention and you are like becoming the “Star” “Sun” “Moon” of the neighbourhoods.  If you were poor mediocre student like me who was literally struggling with her studies especially in mathematics in her school days then people gave you pathetic sympathetic look and made you feel guilty. Having poor grades in school is like a Serious crime, it is worse than killing someone.

Somehow parents are always linked their social status or prestigious reputation with their kid’s school grades.  They bet on their reputation social status on the kid’s scorecard. Parents easily justify their overly pressured parental tactics on their kids with simple words: we want a bright future for them.

From my experience the act of spanking a kid does not simply hurt him physically – it is the emotional sting of it that causes the worst effects. Yess!!  My parents.. my father was often beat me up because of my poor mathematics grades. Mathematics exams were my nightmares. My parents were literally behaving like cruel villains and they were always ready with their beating tools to beat me up if I failed to secure less than 80 percent.  In my middle school (7th grade) my father brutally beat me with his belt and I had so my many bruises in my back.  Result days were like final judgement day. I was literally beaten up every year because of my poor school grades. In my high school final, I just scored only 66% and my father bluntly told it was better for me if  I commit suicide. I was thinking of committing suicide and tried too. I just wanted to die. And my anxiety disorder symptoms have started from that day.

School grades and the rat race among parents are the root cause of the mental stress of every student here in our society. The students suffer from anxiety and traumatic disorder relating to fear of examination. The fear factor is the reason why students suffer from anxiety, depression, and the following consequences. And the fear not only comes from the school society but also from parents, who go to extreme levels to push their children into getting better grades. Every hour, one student commits suicide in India, according to 2015 data (the latest available) from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

It’s not at all surprising for me. I had .. I have been going through the same hell like all other students.  Fulfilling the expectations of the parents are kind of huge burden for every student out there.  I never have that moral encouraging support from my parents from the very beginning.. Right now I am doing my specialisation in law and for my father, I am still a hopeless kid.

Right now I am taking help from my psychologist to overcome my anxiety disorder. Here even taking help from a psychologist is big TABOO. We need to talk about mental stress and seek help if needed. Mental stress is a serious condition that requires medical help.

t2_9ytc2,"Last winter, I was very anxious almost all the time. I had frequent insomnia, and I felt like I was very frequently on the verge of panic during the day, while sober. 

In April, I started to feel bad chest discomfort and felt my heart beating hard (not fast, it made spasm slightly at every heartbeat) almost 24/7. I then started to feel very lethargic, had no energy, shortness of breath and I was certain that I had some sort of heart disease. I stopped working out regularly and was listening to every sign my body was giving me.

In May, I ended up in the ER because of what I thought was an irregular heartbeat. I got assigned to do various tests (echocardiogram, EKG, stress test, holter), and got thorough bloodwork done.

Fast forward to today, I went to see my cardiologist. He told me explicitly : \`\`You're heart is normal, you can do anything. You crushed your stress test, your heart's shape is normal and your arrythmia is benign\`\`. 

I'm so relieved. It took me a good 6 months to convince myself that I was healthy.

I think the moral of my story is : If you're anxious about your health, take a step back. Try to think the most rationally possible, almost as if your situation was someone else's. My personal experience with health anxiety and heart symptoms",319,9,328,0.12,0.794,0.087,-0.8818

t2_2ew8ducq,"I'm finally starting to move on from my previous relationship that ended back in April. Over the last month or two I felt I was ready to get myself back out there. The problem was that there aren't any girls at my school or work that I find attractive. So my friend suggested I try a dating app. So I got on bumble and started swiping. 

It took a while but a few weeks ago I finally got matched with someone who seemed genuinly interested in me and didn't just ghost after a few messages like all my previous matches did. So I asked her out, she said yes and gave me her number.

We saw a movie on Saturday, I picked her up from her dorm. I was pretty nervous before but once she got in the car and we just started talking my nerves subsided. I was having a pretty good time talking and flirting with this girl. It was a feeling I hadn't felt in a realllly long time.

We saw the movie, and ended up sitting pretty close by the end of it. Movie finished, I asked if she wanted to get food but she said she had to work (she's an RA on her floor so she sometimes has really late shifts). So I drove her back to her dorm, conversation still being pretty fun. I felt like it went well.

Thanks for reading",Went on a date and got ghosted afterwards,Anxiety,5,dbw1ue,False,"I'm finally starting to move on from my previous relationship that ended back in April. Over the last month or two I felt I was ready to get myself back out there. The problem was that there aren't any girls at my school or work that I find attractive. So my friend suggested I try a dating app. So I got on bumble and started swiping. 

It took a while but a few weeks ago I finally got matched with someone who seemed genuinly interested in me and didn't just ghost after a few messages like all my previous matches did. So I asked her out, she said yes and gave me her number.

We saw a movie on Saturday, I picked her up from her dorm. I was pretty nervous before but once she got in the car and we just started talking my nerves subsided. I was having a pretty good time talking and flirting with this girl. It was a feeling I hadn't felt in a realllly long time.

We saw the movie, and ended up sitting pretty close by the end of it. Movie finished, I asked if she wanted to get food but she said she had to work (she's an RA on her floor so she sometimes has really late shifts). So I drove her back to her dorm, conversation still being pretty fun. I felt like it went well.

The concept of engaging our emotions for dealing with depression naturally

To fight depression effectively, we need to realize that it’s just a feeling after all.

We have all sorts of emotions during the day.

Depression is just one of them, even though it’s a powerful one.

Tim Matthews, the founder of The Powerful Man, gives one good example of how we create it:

&gt;“When we start to think that we should be farther ahead than who and where we are now, we begin to feel so much pressure which can lead to depression.”

Even if we feel depressed, we can switch to another emotion instantly.

For example, I feel love whenever I give a hug to my kid.

Which means I can switch to that emotion voluntarily.

My current emotion is the one that I choose to feel by focusing on it.

Tony Robbins has this concept called the Triad.

Changing our feeling requires changing the following three things: 

1. physiology: posture and breathing
2. focus: what we think about
3. language: what we say to ourselves when we think about it

Here I am talking about the second part: *focus*.

Let me show how I replace a negative emotion with a positive one using my focus.

**Step #1: Have a memory associated with a strong positive emotion**

I have this memory of feeling like a winner.

A few years ago, I went to a park on a date with a girl.

We took a walk for about an hour.

When we returned to my car, I pushed the button on the door to unlock it.

But it wouldn’t unlock.

I was confused because my key was supposed to be in my pocket and the car was supposed to unlock.

But what if I didn’t have the key?

I looked around for the key but it was nowhere to be found.

I lost it indeed.

So I called a taxi to take the girl home and grab the second key from my home.

In the morning, I decided to go look for the key.

I thought that would be a waste of time.

I mean what are the chances to find the key in a huge park where we walked a lot.

But somehow I trusted my intuition.

I drove back to the park and started following our yesterday’s path.

I was 100% sure I had no chance.

A large park, high grass, and a small key.

And sure enough, there it was, lying in the grass, waiting for me.

Man, this looked like a miracle.

I felt ecstatic for so many reasons.

I don’t like to lose things and I avoided losing the key.

It was quite expensive to restore and I didn’t want the hassle.

And most importantly, I couldn’t believe that I actually found it.

It might not sound like a big deal to you.

But it doesn’t matter!

What does matter is that for me it was a miracle.

I couldn’t believe it.

And I committed this feeling to memory.

**Step #2: Rely on this memory to recall the emotion**

Now I use this memory as a go-to place for things like winter depression or any other negative thoughts really.

See, I noticed that it could help me just a couple of days after finding the key.

I was running and really pushing myself.

It felt hard, but then I suddenly remembered about the key.

And running felt less difficult instantly.

So I said to myself:

“If I can use this memory to change my state when I run, how about other situations?”

So the next time I felt depressed, I replayed that memory.

I recreated the entire experience in my mind as vividly as possible.

Summer park smells.

Sounds of the wind in the trees.

How the morning sun felt on my skin.

How I noticed the key.

The unbelievable feeling of victory.

The gratitude about trusting my intuition.

And feeling happy telling the girl that I found it.

Replaying that memory took me about two minutes.

And it was already worthwhile because at least in those few minutes, I didn’t feel depressed.

I felt elated.

But it didn’t really last just two minutes.

In fact, I stayed elated.

And I would keep reminding myself of the key from time to time.

That was enough to renew my focus.

And whenever I felt depression coming back strong, I replayed the entire experience again for a stronger effect.

That's it: dealing with depression naturally is that easy!

**Step #3: Keep programming yourself**

As I kept using this memory, it worked even more effectively.

The idea is to make it so habitual that it happens automatically.

In fact, we do it with negative emotions all the time.

We keep thinking of something bad and we feel depressed.

That’s because our mind is focused on survival and keeps looking for what is wrong.

But if we can train ourselves to feel negative emotions, we can do the same with the positive ones!

It just takes more practice and patience.

As we practice shifting from negative to positive emotions, we program them into our subconscious mind.

And eventually, we are able to call those positive emotions just as quickly as the negative ones.

Start dealing with depression naturally today

**Conclusion**

There you go: there is no reason for living with depression when it’s just a matter of focus.

Instead of focusing on what’s bad in your life, you have the power to focus on a positive emotion.

Find a memory when you felt elated. It doesn’t have to be as big as winning a Nobel prize. What matters is how excited you felt at the moment.

Replay that moment in your mind in detail so that you feel the positive emotions in your body.

And then keep focusing on those positive emotions to avoid the negative ones.

When you feel that the negative emotions start creeping back in, replay the moment in detail again.",Dealing with Depression Naturally - Feel Better FAST Without Medication,Anxiety,0,dpztug,False,"You might be depressed right now.

It just takes more practice and patience.

As we practice shifting from negative to positive emotions, we program them into our subconscious mind.

And eventually, we are able to call those positive emotions just as quickly as the negative ones.

Start dealing with depression naturally today

**Conclusion**

There you go: there is no reason for living with depression when it’s just a matter of focus.

Instead of focusing on what’s bad in your life, you have the power to focus on a positive emotion.

Find a memory when you felt elated. It doesn’t have to be as big as winning a Nobel prize. What matters is how excited you felt at the moment.

Replay that moment in your mind in detail so that you feel the positive emotions in your body.

And then keep focusing on those positive emotions to avoid the negative ones.

When you feel that the negative emotions start creeping back in, replay the moment in detail again. Dealing with Depression Naturally - Feel Better FAST Without Medication",960,10,970,0.136,0.683,0.181,0.9941

For context, I am a white male with long hair, and I live in Texas. Despite the fact the some may consider my appearance to be that of a “pothead”, I have extreme anxiety surrounding doing illegal things. I follow rules and the law to the best of my ability.

Today, I was pulled over by a state trooper because my rear left taillight was out. I knew it was out and planned on changing it extremely soon. I figured he simply wanted to let me know about it. He had me roll my window down and explained just that. I handed him my insurance and ID card and he asked me if I still lived at the same address, to which I replied that I did.

He then asked me to get out of my vehicle. I immediately became extremely nervous, because I had zero idea why I would need to. Nevertheless, I complied and slowly got out of my vehicle. We stepped onto the side of the road to talk.

He started by asking “when was  the last time you smoked marijuana?”

External note for reddit: I have never smoked marijuana. I do not sell marijuana. I am never around marijuna. I am a bit of a loner and therefore never have anyone in my car besides my fiancee, who also has never smoked. She is very against doing drugs. I simply abstain from doing drugs because I am so paranoid and anxious of being caught. 

I replied that I had never smoked marijuana before. He claimed that he smelled marijuana in my vehicle and knew I had been smoking. I explained to him again that I have never smoked. He asked if anyone had been in my car who had been smoking, to which I explained the above bit about how no one is ever in my car. He then asked if I had any marijuana in my vehicle, to which I said no. He said that I needed to be careful who I hang around because I could get in a lot of trouble.

He told me to wait in the grass where he could see my hands, where he took my ID card to look me up. I stood there, dazed, confused, and on the verge of a panic attack. I tried as hard as I could to retain my composure.

He stepped out and he handed me a small piece of paper to sign that said I understood my infraction (taillight being out) and said there was no ticket/fine. He once again reiterated that I need to be careful who I hangout with and told me to have a good day.

Overall he was very respectful and did not come across as rude or hostile, but I immediatey started having one of the worst panic attacks of my life once I got into my vehicle and drove off. 

This happened 10 hours ago. I deal with moderate depression and anxiety and I have felt at an all time low due to this. I have always been a very good kid who follows the rules, I received
my IB diploma in highschool and had good grades. I’ve never been arrested and never gotten in any legal trouble. I have never taken drugs. About the most illegal thing I’ve ever done is checking my phone while driving.

I cannot shake this insane sense of anxiety and depressive feeling that this has caused. Did a police officer lie to me about smelling marijuana? Did he stereotype me? Could someone have been smoking in a parking lot near my car? 

I just wanted to write how I feel and I wonder if anyone has ever been in the same situation? I know that the situation could have been a lot worse and I realize I am lucky I did not get a ticket, or even hurt. But this entire experience has me feeling traumatized.

t2_4x78arem,"Back in 2017 after my daughter was born I had a breakdown, I was 18 had a newborn, stressful job, a rocky relationship and the pressure just got too much. I lost my job, partner and have stayed in doors pretty much ever since,

Since then my life has been in pieces, I had another job in 2018 but lost it due to being too nervous to confront my boss about how he was treating me so I just left, I’ve been looking for work ever since.

My health has declined, I’m overweight, I don’t sleep or socialise and I have awful thoughts.

My family doesn’t understand as I’m “not the type” Ive been claiming benefits because I’m looking for work, but the truth is I can’t. Every time a job opportunity comes up I buckle, I can’t answer the phone, I can’t leave the house. 

I signed up to an agency and got a job offer, on the day I knew I couldn’t handle it and called to cancel, but I was so nervous about the phone call. I called quickly and broke down to the poor women on the phone and just told her I wasn’t ready and hung up, I nearly passed out.

Now the day has come where I have to explain to my doctor, I have no idea what to say. I’ve been here before to get sick notes but all those times I feel like it looked like I was just trying to bunk off of work. I also have to explain this to the job centre.

I’ve not even told my mum that I’m planning on stopping my work search I don’t know what to say there either. My family just think I’m being lazy.

I can barely speak to people, I can’t take phone calls, I can’t even answer my own door. The depression is bad and it feels like the only way to let everyone know is to hurt myself.

I have tried therapy before but ended up abandoning it, anti depressants help but then I’m just existing. Neither happy or sad. 

I have finances, board to pay and my daughter to think about. Should I go for sick pay? Can I even get that? 

I have an appointment with a therapist on the 18th of Nov. I just don’t know if anyone will understand. 

What do I say to my doctor? My support worker? My own mum?

What is it that’s wrong with me? I know in my gut there’s something wrong.

Sorry for essay, I literally have nowhere else to turn.

TL;DR I believe I have a mental issue, maybe several. I have no job but need the money. I have to explain to everyone what’s going on and I don’t know what to say or do next.","I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what’s wrong.",Anxiety,2,dq28vp,False,"Back in 2017 after my daughter was born I had a breakdown, I was 18 had a newborn, stressful job, a rocky relationship and the pressure just got too much.

She hit her hand on the locker and got a little hurt.
I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING. Like are you okay or anything.

Then out of no where i asked: When is the science test?? She looked at me weirdly kinda bored and answered: idk i dont really care about that test.

I’m taking away something from someone else who deserves it more than I do.

Soo I have had alot of insecurities in my life, and almost all of them are related to looks. Coincidentally almost all of my biggest insecurities are things that my family in one way or another shamed me for. But I have one that has controlled my life alot more than any other. It's about my penis.

A few years ago I made a similar post about the same issue (another account) and you had some great answers. I was 17 at the time and I had avoided sexual interactions as much as I possibly could, because I was so terrified of what they would think of the size of my penis ( size is 6.4 inches in lenght and 4.6 inches in girth. It's mainly the girth that is troubling me.). Anyways I took alot of the advice and for a long time I saw a big improvement. I decided to go for my dream girl and I got her! Nothing of the bad things I thought would happen actually happened. We have actually been together for a couple of years now!

At the beginning I was feeling confident for the first time in my life. But that slowly died out. Even though I feel better now than I ever did before the anxiety and feelings of inadequacy never really leaves me, and its always related to my penis. Sometimes I see things from a different perspective, ""maybe my penis is perfectly fine, maybe I am enough"". Those feelings and thoughts proves just to be temporary though and the negative thoughts starts coming back. So when I do have these negative thoughts (which is about 70% percent of the time) the following behaviour and feelings occurs. Rumination (It becomes everything I can think about), Anxiety (mostly over sex, even with my own girlfriend), self measuring every day, videofilming myself naked from different angles everyday, and seeking some type of confirmation on the issue on blogs and forums.

THIS. NEVER. STOPS. I AM SO TIRED OF THIS. No matter how many times I do these silly things like measure myself it never satisfies me. I do it agian and agian hoping to get some more information that will make understand the issue more clearly, but it never comes. I have thought about seing a therapist but I can't fucking imagine sharing this in person. I'm ashamed. Everything else in my life is going great, and I am happy with it all but this really fucks my quality of life up. Enough is enough, I want to take my Life back.

You guys helped me immensly last time (I truly am a different person in alot of other aspects) and I hope you can do it agian. I have decided to take your guys smartest advice and follow it. I will then report back to you in 3 months and tell you if it has helped somewhat or not. So tell me reddit, WHAT CAN I DO??

Even though I feel better now than I ever did before the anxiety and feelings of inadequacy never really leaves me, and its always related to my penis. Sometimes I see things from a different perspective, ""maybe my penis is perfectly fine, maybe I am enough"". Those feelings and thoughts proves just to be temporary though and the negative thoughts starts coming back. So when I do have these negative thoughts (which is about 70% percent of the time) the following behaviour and feelings occurs. Rumination (It becomes everything I can think about), Anxiety (mostly over sex, even with my own girlfriend), self measuring every day, videofilming myself naked from different angles everyday, and seeking some type of confirmation on the issue on blogs and forums.

THIS. NEVER. STOPS. I AM SO TIRED OF THIS. No matter how many times I do these silly things like measure myself it never satisfies me. I do it agian and agian hoping to get some more information that will make understand the issue more clearly, but it never comes. I have thought about seing a therapist but I can't fucking imagine sharing this in person. I'm ashamed. Everything else in my life is going great, and I am happy with it all but this really fucks my quality of life up. Enough is enough, I want to take my Life back.

You guys helped me immensly last time (I truly am a different person in alot of other aspects) and I hope you can do it agian. I have decided to take your guys smartest advice and follow it. I will then report back to you in 3 months and tell you if it has helped somewhat or not. So tell me reddit, WHAT CAN I DO??

TLDR: Got much anxiety about penis size, need solid advice. Will update results in 3 months. PLEASE. Need advice on embarrasing issue",514,6,520,0.082,0.808,0.11,0.9373

28yo now and as a kid I definitely had anxiety. The suffer in silence type. When it came to anything even mildly nerve-racking to someone with less anxiety I would have butterflies brawling in my stomach. Talking to girls or people I didn't know, standing up and introducing myself or presenting... I would seize up inside, voice would tremble, I could not think straight and I would converse like a buffoon. 

Anyways... the main point here is to look back at my butterlies or, as others describe it, that ugly, nasty pit in your stomach which I think most of us get.

They're gone.

After my first ever and very major panic attack last year... it almost never came back. I noted this with my therapist and doctors. It's crazy. For over a year I do not remember it even coming back a little. 

Well maybe a tiny bit... tracing back to about 4 weeks ago I had a major presentation at a local university to give to a room of highly qualified individuals in my field. I got the butterflies back right before I went up and they went away as usual. That was the last I saw of them.

Had a second major panic attack at work the following week where paramedics came and I had to take a week off. Is it connected that they came back during a period of high stress? Maybe.

And now, 4 weeks later I have noticed... during the same situations that, in the past, would have triggered a Cage Match in my stomach now triggers other, classical, symptoms of anxiety. Symptoms like room spinning, brain fog, dizziness, a sense of doom and panic, my short term memory sucks now ect..... no butterflies.

Am I complaining? Somewhat. I wish I had those butterlies back. They were so much easier to contend with vs the symptoms I have now. Eventually, like the butterflies, I will wrestle these symptoms down from excruciating to bearable but, to be honest, I miss them. They were not that bad.

If you so desire, I'd appreciate any kind of feedback.

Thank you for reading this far, here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl97I8gDdps56fepDMx8pGtjIU2V6VdSe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl97I8gDdps56fepDMx8pGtjIU2V6VdSe&amp;fbclid=IwAR2eVY6q7P2AxZQhNAPcG31NyxfNVe5QV-NkK5cRYj4ETtPpkD2GC7bUSDM) I just released a short album and thought I'd share it with y'all.",90,13,103,0.115,0.684,0.201,0.8594

I'm worrying about thoughtforms. I saw a woman online who said she has literally seen thoughtforms form in the air in front of her.


I messaged her and she said I have ocd and she replied with this 


Don't be afraid of thought forms. We all make them constantly. If you see one you do not like, just visualize what you do want and replace the old with the new. Otherwise, let them come and go on their own.

I'm worried I will have to constantly imagine destroying this thought forms as a new compulsion. 

I have a really weird metaphysical obession where I fear I will enter the perspective/mind of someone bad. As mad as it sounds, I saw a video by teal swan who provided a visualization technique on how to do this. And in magick I've seen several visualizations that seem to support this idea. Such as assumption 


""You just visualize your target person (with your eyes open) in front of you, a real living image of the person you wish to match.

It might take you a few minutes to really get into the feeling of them being there. And when you feel that image of them is as real as you can make it, you just physically step into it.

(Of course, to someone watching, you are stepping into nothing but an empty space on the floor)

As you step into that image, now feel yourself as that person. The trick is not to feel yourself as you within them but instead to feel you as that person...there should be no feeling of separation.

If you get it right, you will almost feel like you are not yourself anymore.

And in this state of vibrational attunement, thoughts will pass easily between the two of you, and things that you think you want to do (as them), they will also be thinking they want to do...if they are in a situation where they can be receptive to their thoughts in that moment.

Me &amp; my girlfriend (well, fiancée now) are very naturally vibrationally in-tune so it's quite easy for me (using this method) to pick up her thoughts, or make her look towards me when she is off in the distance across a crowded room, or get in touch when she is uncontactable by normal means.

How you use a method like this is really up to you and your imagination.

It's also a great way to get rapport with someone you wish to like you, for example, at a job interview. You just step into the person interviewing you while they are interviewing you and you'll both seem to be on the same wavelength...because literally you will be :)

Of course, you don't literally get up out of your seat and step into an image of them while they are talking to you, you just do it in your mind...shifting your body slightly in your seat as you merge with them helps a lot to give you the feeling of stepping into them.

This is a very old occult technique that is spoken about in hushed tones in certain mystical circles because there is a fear that it can be used for the manipulation of others. Indeed, these days you'll get many mind-control and romantic/casual datingauthors selling you this basic method for the sole purpose of manipulating others.

You can waste a lot of time with techniques like this making other people do little things for you here and there. Myself, I spent years playing around with this sort of stuff before I eventually got bored of it.

You see, in the end, it's really quite hard work ""manipulating"" others. :)

I put ""manipulating"" in quotes in that last sentence because ultimately you cannot make anyone do anything they definitely don't want to do. Try it if you don't believe me - nothing bad will happen, you'll just end up disappointed. There's a lot of misguided fear-mongering that goes on with people who warn about using techniques like this...and almost invariably those people have never tried these methods and have no real idea how they work anyway...much like in the world of manifesting techniques, in fact :)

What you'll eventually find about using methods like this to ""manipulate"" others is that it's a hard, painful and ultimately un-satisfying way to live your life.

If you think about it, constantly trying to control the behavior of others makes you a slave to who they are, their whims, their ever-changing moods and fancies. A prison guard is just as much a prisoner as the prisoner s/he is guarding :)""

Excuse my English, it's not my native language.

Context: I was 8 and a ""bully"" (or however you wanna call it), me and my mates used to pick on a boy in our class (because he was short and ginger).

One day, we went to a school trip to a swimming pool, I was having fun with some friends when this boy (Let's call him Tom) appeared, I aproached him and started to mess around. I decided it could be a funny idea if I ""drowned"" him, like pull him underwater then take him out of the water several times. When I stopped with my ""joke"" he had really drowned, teachers tried CPR, didn't work.

It's been almost 8 years now and I'm living in a foster home.

I deeply regret everything, it feels like I haven't slept in years, whenever I try to close my eyes I see his face. I killed a kid because I wanted to have ""fun"" and ""be cool"".

I have social anxiety, I can't even leave my house some days, I am unable to talk to people properly and I am terrified to death of police cars (with those flashing blue and red lights) and police officers.

Excuse my English, it's not my native language.

Context: I was 8 and a ""bully"" (or however you wanna call it), me and my mates used to pick on a boy in our class (because he was short and ginger).

One day, we went to a school trip to a swimming pool, I was having fun with some friends when this boy (Let's call him Tom) appeared, I aproached him and started to mess around. I decided it could be a funny idea if I ""drowned"" him, like pull him underwater then take him out of the water several times. When I stopped with my ""joke"" he had really drowned, teachers tried CPR, didn't work.

It's been almost 8 years now and I'm living in a foster home.

I deeply regret everything, it feels like I haven't slept in years, whenever I try to close my eyes I see his face. I killed a kid because I wanted to have ""fun"" and ""be cool"".

A couple months ago I had a recurrence of my anxiety disorder.  It manifests in severe panic attacks, depression and obsessive thinking.  This time around it happened after I tapered off an ssri.  While tapering i started reading message boards of people who were also coming off ssris and internalized all there horror stories about years of suffering, protracted withdrawal, developed an intense fear of PSSD, etc.  I pushed through but couldn’t get rid of the feeling that something was wrong with me, and ended up relapsing into panic disorder.  Now I’m back on medication and it is helping a little, but I am nowhere near where I was before all this.  

The thing is, this isn’t my first time becoming obsessed with catastrophic outcomes.  My first bout with panic disorder when I was a kid, I was obsessed with the typical stuff, heart problems and a fear of schizophrenia (my aunt was schizophrenic).  Later obsessions were MS, fibro, chronic fatigue, borderline personality disorder, and now obsessions over a life ruined by medication.   My physical symptoms of all these things only tend to manifest when I’m extremely anxious.  The thing they all have in common and is they are incurable, vague, would make me an feel like an outcast in society, may be impossible to confirm, and this fear that I can’t trust doctors because they can ruin my life, or may be telling me the wrong thing. 

I am currently obsessing over sexual side effects from my Ssri and feeling like I will have to take it for life and will never have a partner as a result.  The thing is, while there are side effects, I have had a decent sex like on them for years and multiple partners who never complained.  But my brain doesn’t compute that and keeps telling me my dick is going to go numb and stop working entirely any minute and I will be alone forever.  Sometimes I even think it feels cold and I get struck with panic that this is the moment it will happen.  This medication obsession makes it so the medication doesn’t even work that well and I feel guilty taking it, even if it is really helping with my panic attacks. 

Another obsession is that I’m sick somehow but don’t know with what.  I get very Cold when I’m anxious, sometimes my joints hurt, and it sets off catastrophic thinking that it’s something vague and incurable, like fibromyalgia or lymes or ms, and I will never be the same.  Prior to this relapse into anxiety I was working out everyday, eating healthy and had energy.  Now I’m exhausted all the time, have stomach issues, pain, and cognitive problems.  

Even after I squash down one fear, say ms, or sexual fears, or vague medication withdrawal theories, I can’t shake the feeling that something is gravely wrong with me and I will have to live the rest of my life with it, and also that it is somehow my fault.

t2_fesmi,"Hello, first post, long-time lurker.

So... I'm moving apartments... I'm going solo and I've never done this before. I found a place that I was in love with, until yesterday.

The resident manager called me up and begged me to relinquish the place I was accepted for (nothing has been signed yet and no money exchanged). The short story is there is another unit someone else was supposed to move into today that just isn't ready, but there are two other available units, mine and a basement apartment.

The other lady wants a balcony or nothing so he calls to see if I would relinquish my place and take the basement suite so she gets the balcony. 

I'm shook, I don't know what to do... I go down there, the place is dece, so I say sure, but there's no concessions on his end. No offer of a reduced rent, no guaranteed parking spot, not even an agreement to put a chain lock on my front door (I'm a girl... Ground floor apartment...).

I go back to work and everyone here is angry. The boyfriend is angry. Everyone says don't do it, call him back and back out.

So I did. He was understandably grumpy, and I suspect this other lady won't be going through with her lease.

The thing is... She could have temporarily moved into the basement suite until her apartment was ready. That's what he asked me if I wanted to do if I made the move. But why is this suddenly all on my shoulders? I just want the apartment I got accepted for.

I have a walkthrough for my original unit today, where possession becomes official and I'm full of dread now. This sucks so much, I feel sick. I don't know whether his attitude towards me is going to be shitty or whether he's cool because he knows he put me in a difficult position when he shouldn't have. I don't know. My head is a mess, my blood pressure is sky high. 

I am relatively new to the world of highly anxious people... I've had a couple of panic attacks in the past, but ever since the beginning of 2019, I'm pretty much a textbook diagnosis for general anxiety, but I haven't seen my doctor about it yet because I don't even know what to say.

I have an important presentation at work next Wednesday which I can probably just manage the stress of with skullcap but I'm worried if I start taking the meds now the initial side effects would be worse than how I feel now.

At this point the meds aren’t working and the mindfulness exercises, excercising and therapy are not helping me enough I can get out of bed and show maybe but I lost my job and now I just need some advice please.

t2_iravp,"Hi, everyone. First post to this sub and I wanted to share a quick thought with you...

I've recently been reading...

Talking to Crazy: How to Deal with the Irrational and Impossible People in Your Life by Mark Goulston.

In the book, Mark has the reader run through some exercises to identify their own crazy so they can inoculate themselves when they talk with the crazy people in their lives. (It's a great book by the way and I highly recommend it.)

I've read several other books on anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy so these concepts aren't new.

However, one thing I realized about myself is that when I feel the anxiety coming on, it's more than likely that a trigger has been hit by either my situation, or the person I'm interacting with. When I have this realization, I attempt to move towards relaxation techniques to try and reduce my anxiety.

t2_1cx1dvzg,"I recently got diagnosed and the only family I told was my mom. Recently I worked up the courage to tell my cousin’s family I had anxiety, as her brother has it worse than I do, and they took it really well. I even gave him a few of my techniques to try and they seem to be helping. 

The person I was most afraid to tell was my stepsister. She has a baby girl who was born super small, and likes to squirm around, so I often get afraid I’ll drop her or do something I’ll regret. Often my anxiety would make me think I hurt her in some way: one time I went on vacation with her and she started crying so I tried to play with her, but she kept crying and wouldn’t stop. I thought for at least an hour I shook her too hard (I didn’t shake her more like made her dance but anxiety lol), until she calmed down and was fine again. But I just sat there for an hour thinking “I’m so sorry I hurt the baby!” I told my mom and she said “you can’t keep working yourself up like that.” 

My greatest fear was telling her that and she wouldn’t let me hold the baby again. After all, I could get a panic attack and drop her, since as a newborn I was very anxious about holding her because she was so small, and almost had a panic attack doing it the first time I held her standing up. At least until her boyfriend assured me I was doing fine. 

But I told her mom and she took it really well. I didn’t even make a big spectacle of it, I just gave my niece my anxiety keychain to play with because she likes to grab stuff and when my stepsister asked, I said it was an anxiety keychain and I had anxiety. 

She then asked if it helped me and where to buy some more. And it was like a huge weight got lifted off my chest. 

I think I was worried for nothing. My stepsister works with disabled kids (granted physically disabled mostly), so I’m probably nothing new. It’s just I figured, I’m not at school and you often have to see me. Heck maybe she always figured I had anxiety as I was having visible mental health problems around a year ago.

t2_3oglf,"So today I figured out, probably like a few times in the past (and then forgot when I was healthy for long periods of time), that

anxiety puts an actual weight or force on your nerves, comparable to the weight / force on your nerves you feel when you do exercise lifting weights higher than normal or when you have to push yourself to do those last 2 extra laps around the track while jogging or running. 

It's the same struggle, the same inability to bear the force or burden and if you exert enough will and grunt it out and fight the depressive force, you get out of the rut.

Brute force on your nerves works for some while, say an hour, till you start slowly imagining and worrying again and get mired in the same heavy web and get bogged down.

Because anxiety and/or depression cause the same strength signals in your nerves that heavy weights or extra running laps produce on your (other) nerves, being able to fight one produces ability to fight the other.

So, developing will power in one activity, translates into will power in other activities. That is to say, regular exercise and use of will power _does_ help you beat anxiety and depression.

So get out of the house, go for a jog, hit the gym, or just do skipping or jumping or spot jogging where you push yourself to the point of fatigue and then a little more beyond it.

As an added bonus, being really exhausted, you will be able to sleep better and being hungry you will be able to eat better.

Stop reading, start exercising. 

Even now, just get up, move away from the computer and start doing some squats or skipping.

It only works if you _do_, not if you _read, like, share, comment or subscribe_ or nod in agreement.

So, developing will power in one activity, translates into will power in other activities. That is to say, regular exercise and use of will power _does_ help you beat anxiety and depression.

So get out of the house, go for a jog, hit the gym, or just do skipping or jumping or spot jogging where you push yourself to the point of fatigue and then a little more beyond it.

As an added bonus, being really exhausted, you will be able to sleep better and being hungry you will be able to eat better.

Stop reading, start exercising. 

Even now, just get up, move away from the computer and start doing some squats or skipping.

It only works if you _do_, not if you _read, like, share, comment or subscribe_ or nod in agreement.

Good luck! Anxiety and lifting weights or fighting fatigue",305,7,312,0.146,0.754,0.099,-0.8475

It's a house share with three others in their 20s and 30s, I am 23. I lived at University for over three years, and let's just say it didn't work out too well. The first year was only half a year and the students living there already knew eachother and I was very alone. I never really left my room, but I had good friends at uni so I still did a fair bit of socialising, but I was very anxious and alone when in the flat. 

Second year I lived at halls of residence, which was large and I shared with a lot of students, yet I didn't make a single friend from that residence. I still had a couple of close buddies from the first year who I hung out with on occasion, but other than that I was extremely lonely and got depressed. I stayed in my room all the time, rarely left even to cook or use the toilets. My hygiene was poor because I was too afraid to have a shower, and my diet was poor because I didn't use the kitchen, I mostly used my mini fridge and ate snacks, I was even too afraid to order takeout, and always went shopping at about 1am when there was less people. My anxiety was at its worst.

Third and fourth year (I retook final year because my anxiety and depression had ruined my grades) I lived in a studio flat in private student accommodation, with its own bathroom, double bed, kitchen- the works. I loved it there because I could cook, use the bathroom etc without people around. I also lived next door to my friend at the time. But for some reason I fell into depression even further, ended up completely skipping out on uni for weeks at a time, fell into the wrong crowd, abused drugs (to the point where I was hospitalised twice), made a serious suicide attempt and was evaluated almost being made an impatient at the nearest mental health facility, and ended up losing all my friends because of the person I had become.

t2_2s1tsyue,"Hey all,

So some honestly great news - I talked to my family a bit today about my struggles with anxiety and mental health, and I sat with my mom going through my insurance website to find a Primary Care Physician and a CBT therapist in my plan. (I’m 27 and live across the country from her/them but visiting for the holiday). It was nice to do this and see her support because as a guy I feel like it is hard to open up.

But on the bad end of things - what prompted me to do this was my rising anxiety throughout the week and frequent panic attacks that have been happening. To condense my story, I have had anxiety for awhile, used to go to a therapist but then moved and never got a new one. This year has been a linear ramp up of baseline anxiety with occasional weeks of extremely intense anxiety.

So my hopes are that I can figure something out with these new doctors. Going to start going as soon as I can. My older sister has been telling me that she had been having bad anxiety for the first time ever this year and went to the doctor and got prescribed the lowest dosage of Lexapro (sp?) and she proclaims its helping her immensely.

I’ve never been medicated but I am open to it. My questions for you guys - has anyone found more or less success in medication? Has it ultimately helped or made things worse? Is it really difficult to get off it if you are on it consistently? I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little nervous. I think I want to do what my sister is doing and go on the lowest dosage possible to see what my outcome is and adjust from there. I also plan on going to CBT weekly.

Thank you to anyone who read or responds to this. I feel okay right now, still generally anxious about nothing, but glad I talked to family and am finally getting some help.","Finally getting some professional help, but I have some general thoughts/questions",Anxiety,1,e4iknq,False,"Hey all,
