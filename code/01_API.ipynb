Over these four notebooks we gather data (Notebook 1), clean and analyze data (Notebook 2), develop models (Notebook 3) and develop a Streamlit app (Notebook 4). The work here is done in order to address the problem statement below. In this notebook we develop a function to pull posts from the pushshift.io Reddit api in the subreddit categoires r/OCD and r/Anxiety. We merge and export the dataframe for use in future notebooks."
