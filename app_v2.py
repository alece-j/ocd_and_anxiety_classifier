This is a Streamlit app that hosts a non-medical diagnostic 'suggestion' that uses Natural Langauge Processing to give the user a sense of whether they are more likely to have OCD or Anxiety Disorders.
The model was generated using 1200 posts each from r/OCD and r/Anxiety subreddits from reddit.com.
The best model I found to make this diagnostic tool was a Logistic Regression model with tfidf vectorization of the text.
Please keep in mind this is NOT A MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL and does not replace genuine medical advice.
Our aim is that people would use this tool as a jump off point to do further research and ultimately to consult a medical professional.
